    		<p><a href="http://pinboard.in/">Pinboard</a> bills itself as "antisocial bookmarking." By default, all your bookmarks are private, it doesn't have a design worth sharing (it's not dissimilar from <a href="http://wrongtomorrow.com/">Wrong Tomorrow</a>, another site by Maciej Ceglowski) and built-in sharing features are pretty minimal. Oh, and it's not free. That brings forward one big question: <strong>What's so great about Pinboard?</strong></p>
<h3>Speed</h3>
<p>When you visit the page, three elements are given obvious visual precedence: the brand, the main navigation, and the time it took for the page to load. The current page I'm on? 0.044 seconds, or 44 milliseconds. So what's the difference between .044 seconds and one second? And why would a company make this their third most-weighted design element?</p>
<p>One study, from The Human Oriented Technology Lab suggests that your visitors <a href="http://www.carleton.ca/hotlab/Abstracts/LindgaardG.FernandesG.Dud.html">judge your site in 50 milliseconds</a>, or 1/20th of a second. Obviously, visitors aren't leaving your site if you're not ready within that 50 millisecond threshold, and this is only one study. But it does show the importance of speed and time—revealing that we have less time than we think to impress.</p>
<p>Prefer to speak revenue? BlinkList.com made an improvement of a few milliseconds, and they saw their <a href="http://blog.mindvalleylabs.com/gone-in-4-seconds-why-your-page-load-speed-matters/176/">revenue jump 25%</a>. Speed matters.</p>
<p><a href="/images/blog-img/2009-07-17-pinboardbig.jpg" class="image group"><img src="/images/blog-img/2009-07-17-pinboardsmall.jpg" alt="Pinboard" class="center" /></a></p>
<h3>The Cost</h3>
<p>I'm not sure exactly how Pinboard got their idea for what to charge for their service (Although some insight is given. It was apparently conceived by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_Schachter">Joshua Schachter</a>, previously of Del.icio.us, but I may be interpreting <a href="http://twitter.com/PinboardIN/statuses/2629590295">this Twitter update</a> incorrectly.), but here is how it breaks down: total number of users * $.001 is what you pay . As of now, it's $4.84, which means 4,84[0-9] people have signed up for the service, if I'm correct. I believe the average amount they have paid is half of $4.84, which would be $2.42, which is around $11,724 for the developer. That's a pretty good boost towards development. But a rich developer isn't the only reason charging like this is such a great idea.</p>
<ul>
    <li>It slows growth. Some services grow too fast, and they just can't handle the server loads and difficulties of a growing business. Twitter was a good example of this, although they seem to have made it through their growing pains.</li>
    <li>It values early adopters. It makes the barrier of entry lower for the people who are likely to give better feedback, be more involved and spread the word about your product.</li>
    <li>It discourages unintended use. <a href="http://ask.metafilter.com/">Ask Metafilter</a> charges users a $5 one-time signup fee, and it's mostly a spam-free thriving community. It's amazing what a small barrier-to-entry can do to zap a spambot.</li>
    <li>It keeps out advertising. I place a lot of value on my attention, and if I can shave seconds and manage my focus more effectively, I'll gladly drop a few bones to do so.</li>
</ul>
<p>All in all, this small fee provides a boost to development and will make Pinboard a vastly improved product. It's surprising to me the number of people who won't pay a fee of less than a fast food meal for an application, program, or service that they'll use day-in and day-out. This is pretty essential capitalism—if something is worth it, then pay for it. The world will be a better place for it.</p>
<h3>And A Little More</h3>
<p>Speed is undoubtedly the most important interface priority, but beyond that, there are a few other niceties. Clean URLs, AJAX goodness and pure simplicity make the interface a pleasure.</p>
<p>Outside of the visual interface, the idea of implementing a "to read" permatag is great. So often I want to mark something to read later, and it just permeates my bookmarks indefinitely.</p>
<p>And don't miss out on the copywriting. It's pithy, clever, and wonderful&mdash;complete with little shots at <a href="http://corvusconsulting.ca/2009/02/ma-gnolias-bad-day/">Ma.gnolia</a> and Del.icio.us, if you can find them. The features roadmap is insightful, and the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/pinboard-dev/">developer group</a> is responsive and helpful.</p>
<h3>But It's Not All Peachy</h3>
<p>It's certainly a new service, and it shows in their interface. Some things are nonsensical or lacking as far as what you'd hope in using the service.That said, here are my gripes, mostly interface-related, as I feel the feature set is pretty satisfactory:</p>
<ul>
    <li>There's no way to toggle views between private and public items. And the private/public delineator next to your username is disconnected from any context to suggest meaning.</li>
    <li>Bulk editing is weak at best, handled only by the burdensome process of bulk starring, loading a new page, and then editing. Tons of room for improvement here.</li>
    <li>Settings are pretty text-heavy. The majority of the information is irrelevant to to the average user and could be revealed only when necessary, but I'm nitpicking here.</li>
    <li>Hover behavior needs a little attention. When hovering on a star, you get a cursor rather than pointer, and when hovering on any other link, you get nothing. This would make a big difference in usability.</li>
</ul>
<p>All in all, I'd give the service a heavy recommendation. And you can check out <a href="http://pinboard.in/u:jpcody/">my bookmarks</a> on your way to signing up.</p>

    <p>Cardon Copy, takes the vernacular of self-distributed fliers and tear-offs we have all seen in our neighborhoods.

I then replace the original with the redesign in its authentic environment.</p>

<p>A noble exercise, but one <a href="http://www.idsgn.org/posts/guerrilla-typography/#comments">idsgn commenter</a> aptly noted:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>A cool idea, but I am afraid the missing cat signs (specifically) would backfire. There is a visceral, human urgency in handmade/unprofessional signs asking for help. A stylized presentation would make the average passerby skeptical and therefore less likely to help.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think something like this is more desirable as a design practice than an actual stealing and replacing of work. I would be more likely to think this was a design project than an actual plea.</p>

    		<p>I hail from near Atlanta, with its bastard-child MARTA. I've spent a summer in Los Angeles, the paragon of terrible public transportation. I feel I have the experience necessary to say that New York's public transportation system is absolutely incredible.</p>
<p>My wife and I, when we were dating, had the benefit of being the progeny or Delta employees, so skipping school looked like this from time-to-time: We would wake up before the sun to head to the airport. We'd catch the first flight of the day to New York City. Upon arrival, we'd hope the bus to the north end of Manhattan, then take the subway to the heart of the city. After exploring the city all day, we'd reverse our route and catch the last flight home that night. And it was all made possible by a well-thought and well-designed transit system.</p>
<p>It looks like that's about <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/24/nyregion/24naming.html">to get more difficult</a> as the MTA tries to sell the naming rights to the Atlantic Avenue station to Barclays of London.</p>
<p>Some corporate entities already have stops named after them, but Jason Kottke, almost as an afterthought, <a href="http://www.kottke.org/09/06/mta-selling-subway-station-naming-rights">makes a very valid point</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>But, without exception, station names are derived from nearby landmarks: streets, airports, schools, stadiums, squares, parks, etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He's spot-on. This is a precedent well-ingrained in the minds of frequent visitors and residents of New York City. You'd like to go to Rockefeller Center? The World Trade Center? Broadway? Oh, all right, there's a subway stop for that. You'd like to go to Barclays? Sure, head to the Barclays stop in Brooklyn, then either recalibrate and head to the financial district in Manhattan, or hail a cab, head to JFK and fly to London. See the problem here? For over a hundred years, the transit system has <em>just made sense</em>. And, especially for the casual visitor, mnemonic stop names are extremely important.</p>
<p>Another issue, albeit with far less financial incentive, is historically motivated. There's something thrilling about seeing names like Atlantic Avenue, Broadway, Canal Street, and 23rd Street go whizzing by. These stops are as iconic as Route 66, Wrigley Field, or Norman Rockwell. It will be sad to see them go <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/blog/big_league_stew/post/Hate-corporate-stadium-names-Use-this-program?urn=mlb,69167">the way of the sports stadium</a>.</p>
<p>And this is a perfect context to send you away to check out <a href="http://designnotes.info/?p=1805">this little piece of design idiocy</a>, also presented to you by the MTA.</p>

<p>I've got a minor fascination with street art and the subversive in general. It's for that reason that I was struck by <a href="http://www.woostercollective.com/2009/06/barrel_monsters.html">this barrel monster</a> created by an NC State University student. It's a bummer that he was arrested, but I imagine street art wouldn't be nearly as fun if it were legalized.</p>

    		<p>Recently, I had the misfortune of reading <a href="http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1899804,00.html">What Will the World Do With More Search Engines?</a>, an online article from <em>Time Magazine</em>, written by Douglas A. McIntyre. I bookmarked it, feeling something should be done or said about the state of journalism online. A couple weeks later, this is both the time and place for that. In order for you to get the full effect of my commentary, as well as for a good laugh, you should go ahead and <a href="http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1899804,00.html">read the article</a>. I'll wait here.</p>
<h3>Done? Great. Let's continue...</h3>
<p>I considered going line-by-line at this article. But honestly, we'd be here for far, far too long. And if you had the patience for reading something longer, you'd have your nose in a literary magazine or, you know, a book. So let's look at a few quick problems that are indicative of one larger problem.</p>
<p><strong>The style.</strong> It's journalism. You don't need to be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Foster_Wallace">David Foster Wallace</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_safran_foer">Jonathan Safran Foer</a>. But you're paid not to be a complete bore. This article's first three sentences read with the same rhythm as my near-deaf grandmother trying to find the right clapping cadence to <em>Amazing Grace</em>. It didn't get better. By the end of the article, it had all the smoothness of a case of the hiccups in the middle of a seizure.</p>
<p><strong>The research.</strong> All right, last time I said, "It's journalism." But I'm not totally convinced of that. The article dismissively explains the marketing strategies of Google's smaller search engine competitors and slips in the faux-statistic that there are 500,000 "search products" available&mdash; all in three sentences. If you listen closely, you can hear McIntyre saying "Ah, screw it." before he laments, "That figure seems high, but it is impossible to disprove." regarding the latter statistic. Overall, there's not a morsel of interesting journalism in the entire piece.</p>
<p><strong>The banalities.</strong> Wow, they really slip some stinkers in there. Exhibit A: "Loyalty is not always a by-product of function, though function often creates loyalty." Exhibit B: "Good is so excellent that it is not good anymore." I rest my case. Not that the insights are, well, insightful in the first place, but the way they are stated makes me feel like I've heard them my entire life. Apparently Mr. McIntyre didn't get the memo that BS at least needs to be <em>interesting to read</em>.</p>
<p>And although it doesn't necessarily fit in any above category, I would be remiss not to mention what goes down in paragraph six. Without any transition whatsoever, McIntyre takes us from discussing search engines, into a metaphor of airplane altitude, then to discussing chip manufacturers. I do have to give credit for finding the perfect climax to the absurdity that came before. It almost felt <strong>right</strong> just how little sense this made.</p>
<h3>Here's the rub.</h3>
<p>I'm not faulting Douglas A. McIntyre for the broad gap between the respectability of his name and his writing. I trust he is a better writer than he showed in this article, quite frankly, because I don't believe it's possible to be paid for writing so poorly. I'm faulting <em>Time</em>.</p>
<p>Like so many of the other print dinosaurs, they just don't get it. They still think that the internet is made of a bunch of fat kids sitting in their parents' basements eating salt and vinegar potato chips. Somewhere in their system of hiring, vetting, editing, and publishing, they said these words: "It's all right. It's just the internet." And they hit "publish" on a big, steaming pile of crap.</p>
<p>So here's a bit of advice for you, <em>Time</em>. Other endangered corporations, you can listen as well. <strong>Just because it's the internet, doesn't mean it can suck.</strong> If anything, it has to suck less. If you wouldn't publish it in print, don't publish it online. If you would publish it in print, consider publishing it online, but only if it fits. I know you're not as stupid as you're acting, so please. Just stop.</p>

    		<p>John Siracusa of Ars Technica recently wrote <a href="http://arstechnica.com/staff/fatbits/2009/05/hypercritical.ars">Hypercritical</a>, an insightful look into the mind of those who were born to critique. It's a skill that I'm trying to develop more each day, but John is just on a whole different level. Don't trust me? Read his <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/reviews/2007/10/mac-os-x-10-5.ars">17-page review of Mac OS X Leopard</a>.</p>
<p>To take a single quote from his look at those who are hypercritical is a great injustice, but I'll do it anyways. But only after you promise to <a href="http://arstechnica.com/staff/fatbits/2009/05/hypercritical.ars">read the whole article</a>. Promise? Cross your heart? Cross it. OK.</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>The point is, ladies and gentleman, that criticism, for lack of a better word, is good. Criticism is right. Criticism works. Criticism clarifies, cuts through, and captures the essence of the evolutionary spirit…</p>
    <p>Okay, let me try that again. Actually, I'm on the same page as Gordon Gekko in one important respect. Like greed, criticism gets a bad rap, especially when it's presented in large doses. It's impolite. It's unnecessarily obsessive. It's just a bummer. But the truth is, precious little in life gets fixed in the absence of a good understanding of what's wrong with it to begin with.</p>

    		<p>There's pretty much only one person I listen to when it comes to Apple predictions. Jon Gruber of <a href="http://www.daringfireball.net">Daring Fireball</a>. And here's a bit of what he has to say about new iPhones tomorrow:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>I expect Apple to announce updated iPhones with significantly faster processors, twice the RAM, and twice the storage. I expected prices to remain the same as the current lineup: $199/299 for 16/32 GB, respectively. The video camera is going to be a major selling point.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He also says that his hunch is that iPhone 3 will carry the moniker <em>iPhone 3GS</em>. I call shenanigans here. It's been a long, long time since Apple has used any sort of acronym system in their naming. Nor do they append letters for the heck of it in the mold of PCs or luxury cars. My money is on leaving the iPhone 3G as a lower entry-point and adding the iPhone 3G Video. But tomorrow will tell.</p>
<p>And Gruber has bad news regarding Snow Leopard:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>But while I am convinced that “Marble” [a potential new OS X user interface] is a real design project at Apple, I no longer believe it is slated for Snow Leopard. A new visual appearance isn’t something Apple can spring on third-party developers at the last moment. If they plan to ship Snow Leopard soon — say, by the end of August — that just isn’t enough time to allow developers to update their software to look good under a new UI theme.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sad news. He's got even more details, so make sure to <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2009/06/wwdc_2009_predictions">read his article</a>.</p>

    		<p>Things here are still being worked out. I've never had a personal site before, and naturally, rather than getting hooked into Blogger, Wordpress, etc., I decided to learn HTML, CSS, Expression Engine, and a little bit of server-side scripting to roll my own. I ended up liking it enough that I'd like to pursue the creation of hypertext professionally.</p>
<p>One thing that truly amazed me is the difficulty of a personal site, compared with some of the other sites I've worked on. I was aghast at how little I know about myself and how difficult it is to make decisions based on one's own personality. I tried brainstorming, doodling, mood boards, and about everything I could think of. I still don't feel like I came up with a site that accurately portrays either how I view myself or how I would like to be viewed. One thing I'm incredibly grateful for through this entire process is the rabbit hole I've been taken down in understanding who I am and what that means through this site. Hopefully version two will present that more clearly.</p>
<p>For now, I thought I'd archive some notes on the design.</p>
<h3>How I Got This Far</h3>
<p>I think some inspiration here would be duly noted. Although the <a href="http://joshuacody.net/thanks">thanks page</a> is also a good place to check out. For various reasons, this site looks almost nothing like any of the sites I'm about to list:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="http://seansperte.com/">Geek &amp; Mild</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://daringfireball.net">Daring Fireball</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://typesites.com/">Typesites</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://jasonsantamaria.com/">Jason Santa Maria</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://www.chrisglass.com/">Chris Glass</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://joshuablankenship.com/">Joshua Blankenship</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>What I particularly like</h3>
<p>I'm pretty pleased with how the texturing came out and the small patch I was able to use and get a decent effect repeating using CSS. Structurally, I think I've also pretty much nailed things down exactly how I want them. I'd like to explain a few of the decisions I made in that regard.</p>
<p><strong>[Page Name].joshuacody.net.</strong> I think this is the simplest URL structure. When telling someone something, it's much easier to say "blank dot blank dot net" than "blank dot net backslash blank." I would, however, like to publicly tirade the squatter at joshuacody.com for messing up my user experience.</p>
<p><strong>The things I love.</strong> I've always known I'd like to include this. I'm fascinated in interviews centering around the things people love and use, and it's why I'm eagerly awaiting <a href="http://bbbbrands.com/">bbbbrands.com</a>. I develop extreme loyalty to the things I own that treat me well, and I feel like I'd love to share that with you. I'm particularly pleased with the way this section turned out.</p>
<p><strong>The footer.</strong> For quite awhile, I struggled over what to put in here. I think this came to be a perfect balance as I now have a contact form on every single page, easy navigation and some other places you can find me on the web. There isn't anything else I wish was in there, and there isn't anything I feel shouldn't be there. I didn't want to embed my Flickr stream or Twitter posts on the site, because if you wanted to be regularly updated on those, you would likely be visiting them individually, not here.</p>
<p><strong>The blog as home.</strong> Content is king. I truly and honestly believe this. Design exists to make content a pleasure and help an individual or organization tell their stories. I'm glad it takes zero clicks to get to the meat of my content, and there is minimal distraction between the top of the page and the content. This will become even more evident in redesigns.</p>
<p><strong>Expression Engine.</strong> Love it. Enough said.</p>
<h3>The things you might be wondering about</h3>
<p><strong>Where are the comments?</strong> I don't think blog comments are helpful. If you'd like to make your opinion known to all, I'd like to encourage you to write a thoughtful, detailed summary and post it to a location of your choosing. If you'd like to make your opinion known to me, I'd like to encourage you to write a thoughtful, detailed summary and send it through the contact form. When reading an entry, you are choosing to consume the content. After you consume the content, you have some more options:
* Forget it.
* Consider it, and internalize it for the sake of later use.
* Consider it, and disagree with it.
* Consider it, and pass it on.
I don't believe giving you the option to comment on a post is actually helpful. But should you post a thoughtful response elsewhere or send me a thoughtful response with permission to reprint, I will make it a point to update entries.</p>
<p><strong>The navigation is in a strange place.</strong> This was a decision I struggled through. I wanted as little as possible between the top of the page and the content. I decided to use the <a href="http://flesler.blogspot.com/2007/10/jquerylocalscroll-10.html">.localscroll jquery plugin</a> to get you from "and more" to the navigation. Even what I have now is a bit much for me, and I hope for version two of the site to adequately address this problem and leave the least possible clutter between page-top and content-top.</p>
<h3>Some Problems</h3>
<p>It's certainly not perfect. I've actually been fiddling with this for probably seven months now, and I just had to get something out the door. I had to convince myself I could go to production, even if it's something I'm not 100% satisfied with. I hope to be and always remain my greatest critic, and I'm on a great start to that here.</p>
<p><strong>The copy.</strong> This goes back to my previous struggles over understanding me. Do I want to be self-aggrandizing? Self-deprecating? Playful? Exciting? This is a personal branding issue&mdash;excuse me, had to get the bile out of my mouth after seriously referring to "personal branding"&mdash;that is bound to send me to the looney bin before I come up with a good answer to it. I feel I need some sort of personality test or an interview from someone who is not me in order to figure this out. I get into ridiculous internal dialogues involving words like actuality, reality, pastiche, and simulacrum, then I find myself <a href="http://twitter.com/lonelysandwich/status/1092663217">disappearing from photographs</a>.</p>
<p><strong>The colors.</strong> Black, brown and bland all over. That will change later.</p>
<p><strong>The type.</strong> I'm not satisfied with my choice of Lucida Grande/Sans Unicode. I haven't thoroughly tested it, but I don't think it's the best cross-browser, cross-platform experience, and I think it's more suited to a technology blog than this humble amalgamation I have here. It also does not work well with the use of Clarendon in the header and footer titles. Again, this will be fixed later.</p>
<h3>The Future</h3>
<p>Version two is already in the works, even before version one is done. A radical stylistic departure from the current version is to be expected. It kind of pisses me off knowing that version one is out in the wild like this, an experiment gone wrong. But hey, that's life. Public design is awkwardly and unexpectedly vulnerable.</p>
