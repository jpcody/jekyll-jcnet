    		<p>Recently, I wrote of <a href="http://joshuacody.net/blog/the_two_types_of_value">two kinds of value</a>, particularly with regards to the things we consume. But there's something that defines us much more than the things we consume. And that's how we spend our <em>time</em>.</p>
<p>And here, we make the same fundamental error as with the things we buy. We look to pack as may things as possible into our days, no matter the cost. We're looking at creating the densest possible days.</p>
<p>There's nothing I could add to <a href="http://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/blog/time-management-how-an-mit-postdoc-writes-3-books-a-phd-defense-and-6-peer-reviewed-papers-and-finishes-by-530pm/">this article</a>, but I'll leave you with a quote on your way to read it.</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>You could fill any arbitrary number of hours with what feels to be productive work. Between e-mail, and crucial web surfing, and to-do lists that, in the age of David Allen, grow to lengths that rival the bible, there is always something you could be doing. At some point, however, you have to put a stake in the ground and say: I know I have a never-ending stream of work, but this is when I’m going to face it. If you don’t, you’ll let this work push you around like a bully. It will force you into tiring, inefficient schedules, and you’ll end up more stressed and no more accomplished.</p>

    		<p>Great leaders are generous. Not as a marketing ploy. Not as a bait-and-switch tactic. Not because they're rich and have nothing better to do with their money. A story will better illustrate why. <sup id="2010_01_07_fnlink1"><a href="
#2010_01_07_fn1">1</a></sup></p>
<h3>A generous man</h3>
<p>One of the most skilled leaders I know is a man you'll likely never meet or read about in a leadership magazine. He owns a mechanical services company in Fayetteville, Georgia. Each year, he throws a Christmas party for all his employees, current and former, and their families. He lives modestly and gives luxuriously. Particularly, I want to tell you what he did for me one spring afternoon.</p>
<p>I was preparing for a short-term trip to Africa&mdash;3 months during the summer of 2006. I was also raising support (no negligible amount) for said trip, and as this man was a neighbor, friend, and former employer, he received a letter asking for financial support.</p>
<p>He contacted me to let me know he had something for me and told me he'd look for a time he was free to get together. Eventually, that time came. He called to ask me if I'd have a few hours in the afternoon. Eagerly, I obliged (and surely canceled any plans I might've had).</p>
<p>He lives about 200 yards from my parents, so I was a bit surprised to see him pull up in his truck that afternoon. He invited me to hop in, and he let me know we were going to run an errand together. Next stop, Lowe's.</p>
<p>As it turns out, a family from their church had a relative who was recently involved in a car accident. She survived, but with a drastically altered life as a quadriplegic. Our errand was to pick up a generator and deliver it to their family so the devices critical to her survival would continue to function in the event of a power outage.</p>
<p>It wasn't simply a give-and-run experience, either. We spent time laughing and talking with their family&mdash;hearing stories of the past and dreams for the future. And on the way out, they gave me the full tour of all this man had already done for them. Building a new deck that was wheelchair-friendly and covered. Converting the front door and patio to accomodate wheelchair access. Bringing meals over for their entire family. His generosity was staggering.</p>
<p>On our way home, he gave me a check that covered half of my entire trip.</p>
<h3>But why generosity?</h3>
<p>When leading others towards a just goal, a leader sets vision and direction, then empowers followers to act freely. Leaders generally don't make their investment in people with goals wildly different from their own, and they usually invest only where they see potential. Their generous investment delivers two things: resources and permission.</p>
<p>It's easy to see that financial generosity gives a recipient the means to move towards a common goal. What's not so obvious is the permission granted by the giving of time or attention. As a leader invests this way in others, she implicitly communicates that the other party <em>deserves</em> her most important resource. In turn, that person is naturally challenged to steward this investment wisely and push harder towards their shared goal.</p>
<p>For me, this investment reminded me that generosity is an essential part of being fully alive and bringing the Kingdom of God to earth. And I learned that generosity isn't an action, but a lifestyle. For his employees, annual Christmas parties are reminders of their value and potential. They actually mean something in his company, and their continued work is appreciated and valued.</p>
<p>Great leaders understand that they are leading people. Whole people. And they will never succeed in achieving goals without the generosity that empowers their co-laborers.</p>
<p>What are you leading others towards? And are you empowering them through your own generosity?<sup id="2010_01_07_fnlink2"><a href="#2010_01_07_fn2">2</a></sup></p>
<ol>
    <li id="2010_01_07_fn1">We're going to define a great leader as someone who is highly skilled at setting goals and motivating others to reach those goals together. We're also going to assume they do these things for just reasons.

    		<p>Before you pursue business opportunities, ask yourself this question:</p>
<p>Do I want to be a <strong>serial entrepreneur</strong>, investing where I see short-term opportunity, and using the ensuing windfall to fund my passions? Or do I want to <strong>build a brand</strong>, pursuing my passions directly as a long-term opportunity?</p>
<p>Neither is better than the other (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Richard_Branson%27s_business_ventures">Richard Branson</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs">Steve Jobs</a>), but deciding early will help you avoid plenty of growing pains.</p>

    		<p>I think our internal value-meters are a bit dull these days. As we face a host of options and products daily, the simplest heuristic is to spread our time and money as thinly as possible. If we buy the most things at the least cost, then surely we will be met with satisfaction.</p>
<p>This is <strong>quantitative value</strong>.</p>
<h3>On quantitative value</h3>
<p>Recently, I've struggled with the ideas of <em>value</em> and <em>density</em>. Marketing trends tell us the two are synonymous. I think the difference is subtle, but its implications are far-reaching.</p>
<p>Just because McDonalds offers more beef per dollar does not make it the better value. Simply because one person can quote a project at a lower number does not make them the better value. In a program, more features for less money does not always equate to a better value.</p>
<p>Too often, we view value as <em>quantity &divide; cost</em>, or density.</p>
<h3>A better way</h3>
<p>Sure, quantitative value is simple, but it's short-sighted. We should actually be calculating <em>quality &divide; cost</em>. Quality is messy. It's inexact. It's <strong>not</strong> quantity. So too often we default to quantity.</p>
<p>Quality is how the new car purchase will hold up in ten years. It's about asking yourself what your goals and values are, then determining whether a purchase leads you towards said goals and values.</p>
<p>Quantitive value only involves a cursory understanding of the product. Qualitive value involves a meticulous understand of yourself.</p>

    		<p>By now, you've surely heard of <a href="http://clientsfromhell.tumblr.com/">Clients From Hell</a>. If not, go ahead and read some of the stories, then come back here.</p>
<p>At first glance, it's funny. You might laugh for awhile as you flip through the stories. But at some point, you should likely come to the following question: <strong>Why are these designers so arrogant and condescending towards their clients?</strong></p>
<h3>I'll tell you why</h3>
<p>Clients generally don't understand the web. They don't know well enough to know that giving away a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Canon-EOS-5D-Mark-II/dp/B001G5ZTLS">Canon 5D Mark II</a> is a good way to get traffic on Twitter. And they don't know well enough to know that this traffic is cheap and won't get them anywhere in the long run. They just did a complete 360-degree turn without knowing it happened.</p>
<p>The things they're asking for&mdash;dogs chasing the cursor on a screen, seventeen different fonts on a page, MySpace sites for kids aged 1-5&mdash;aren't indicative of the fact that they're glaring idiots. (Some exceptions naturally apply.) They're indicative of people coming to you, trustingly, to help them in a medium they don't understand. They're looking to command attention in a space where they're not sure how to achieve that goal.</p>
<h3>The real problem</h3>
<p>So here's a little nugget of information for designers, myself included from time to time: <strong>The problem isn't that your clients are complete morons, the problem is that you're a complete asshole.</strong></p>
<p>Treat your clients as humans&mdash;humans that you can help. They have dreams and goals and aspirations, and they're asking for you to partner with them, to help them in this world of 0s and 1s and usability and standards and nerds. A world they don't understand, but you do.</p>
<p>The real issue is that, for whatever reasons, designers tend to feel we're part of some select aristocracy, doing the masses a service by relating with them. We're short-tempered, impatient, unhelpful, and condescending. Not all, and not always. But many, and often.</p>
<p>And rather than trying to kindly help those who don't understand, we scuttle off to our cyber-nerd-rooms to make them the punch line of our jokes. Real easy to say when you hide behind your IP address or avatar, isn't it?</p>
<h3>A simple manifesto</h3>
<p>Whether I'm designing, dreaming, planning, chatting or other-ing&mdash;online or off, I'll treat others like they're real, human people. People who deserve love and respect. And I hope you'll do the same.<sup id="2010_01_09_fnlink1"><a href="#2010_01_09_fn2">1</a></sup></p>

    <p>The main reason why — to the amazement of many of my colleagues — TV is still such a tremendously popular medium is that no web site beats the speed of the remote control. No screen design can match the high drive of flipping through physical paper. The same can be said for radios. It’s just simpler to switch on the radio and scroll through stations than preparing your iPod. In terms of speed, traditional interfaces are still the benchmark for web designers.</p>
    <p>People started using Twitter and Facebook for direct messages instead of E-mail because they require less physical manipulations to send a message. Future web designers will focus less on surface design but on speeding up processes by cutting reducing physical manipulations. The best way to learn about speedy interfaces is to study everyday interfaces as doorknobs, drawers, shampoo bottles. Web designers need to learn more from traditional product designers.</p>

    		<p>Google Voice is pretty exciting in theory. One number to rule them all, archived and searchable SMS, voicemails stored as text, recording conversations, different rules for different contact groups. You've got to admit, those are some incredible features.</p>
<p>One of it's hilarious downfalls, however, is its inadequate transcription mechanism. I don't know of any better services out there, and it might be a lost cause, but Google Voice gives you some hilariously bad transcripts of voicemails.</p>

    		<p><strong>Warning:</strong> Here be nerdery and hackery that will be more valuable to future Googlers than most who would occasionally read these thoughts. Also, a Mac and <a href="http://panic.com/transmit">Transmit</a> by Panic are here used.<sup id="2010_01_02_fnlink1"><a href="#2010_01_02_fn1">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Recently, Jeff Atwood <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001315.html">ran into a problem</a>. His site, Coding Horror, suffered a catastrophic and complete data loss. Everything was lost&mdash;entries, photos, databases, you name it. For anyone who runs a site, this is a problem. He was able to recover most of his data from loyal readers, Google's cache, and his own, sparse backups.</p>
<p>But most of us don't have the benefit of devout followers making backups of our sites so they can read them offline, print copies to line their mattress with and save us in case of an emergency. So this is what I do, server side<sup id="2010_01_02_fnlink2"><a href="#2010_01_02_fn2">2</a></sup>:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Set up two folders at the root (one level above the document root, which is likely public_html) of my server: one for database backups and the other for entire site backups.</li>
    <li>Create two files at the root of my server: one with a script <a href="http://tips-scripts.com/site_backups">to back up my site</a> and another with a <a href="http://tips-scripts.com/sql_backups">script to back up my databases</a>.</li>
    <li>Run each of these via cron (so they'll run on their own, once per day, at a specified time) at odd times during off-peak hours&mdash;say, the first at 2:37am and the second at 3:06am.</li>
</ul>
<p>At this point, we've got a compressed file in the format of /backup/daynumber.tar.gz (i.e. /backup/30.tar.gz or /backup/14.tar.gz). So naturally, as we circle around to a new month, files are overwritten to save space. So you've got 30 days of backups for your entire site and for your databases, right there. But they're still on the server, which is vulnerable to spilled soup, mean people and the terrorists. So let's move them local.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Create two folders on my personal computer: one for database backups and the other for entire site backups. (Sound familiar?)</li>
    <li>Create a Transmit favorite to connect directly to each of the folders on your server, and name them something simple. ("DB Backups" and "Site Backups" for me.)</li>
    <li>Fire up Automator, and in Library &gt; Internet, choose "Synchronize Files" next to the little Transmit icon.</li>
    <li>Choose my Transmit favorite of database backups, set the sync direction to "Download," sync method to "Update," and the appropriate local folder as my "Local path."</li>
    <li>Save the workflow as a file somewhere memorable and repeat the process for entire site backups.</li>
    <li>Create a new iCal event with an alarm sometime <em>after</em> your daily server backup mentioned above.</li>
    <li>For the alarm action, choose "Open file," and select your Automator workflow for database backups. Create a second event and alarm for entire site backups.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then, in 10 rather convoluted and confusing steps, you'll have an email alert each morning to let you know if you backed up successfully. I also changed the subject of the email it sends me to let me know whether it succeeded or failed, and I have Gmail automatically archive successes so only failures get through to my inbox.</p>
<p>So that's that. I'll open comments on this article as well so anyone can add, subtract or call me an idiot. Oh, also, I'd love to hear anything different you're doing with other setups.</p>
<ol>
	<li id="2010_01_02_fn1">Here is my setup: a <a href="http://site5.com">site5</a> server with PHP5 and a MySQL database. And locally, an iMac running Snow Leopard that stays on 24/7, backs up via Time Machine. Also, Automator (which you have if you're following so far) and Transmit. I don't know enough to know if your mileage will vary, so plan accordingly. <a href="#2010_01_02_fnlink2" class="small_caps">&nbsp;&nbsp;[Jump back]</a></li>

    		<p>Great leaders are grateful. Some of the men and women in my life (many without any online presence to link to, so this certainly isn't a technological point) who have influenced me the most share a common characteristic: <strong>they're incredibly gracious and appreciative.</strong> They affirm. They give. They thank.</p>
<p>But why?</p>
<p>Great leaders appreciate the investment of others, which helped them get where they are. They're not hopelessly nostalgic, but they're insightful enough to know they couldn't have gotten here alone. They're grateful for the muses on their journey. Great leaders are also famously prescient. They understand what's coming, and they're grateful for those that will help them get there.</p>
<p>But more than anything, great leaders understand people. Before delivering a new product, moving a non-profit towards viability, or beginning a new venture, they understand humanity&mdash;needs, desires, feelings. Understanding those things, they deliver products or services that meet needs or desires, and the most successful leaders deliver experiences with positive feelings. The truly astute know their co-laborers, peers, superiors, and team members have the same needs, desires, and feelings as their consumers. And they know their praise, in whatever form it comes, fuels them towards a common mission.</p>
<p>And when you grasp that, this naturally follows: <strong>in the long term, unless you're grateful, you'll never be successful.</strong></p>

    		<p class="note"><span class="small_caps">Editor's Note: </span>Somehow I missed that I originally posted this as <em>5 Albums to Remember From the 90s</em>. The error was sever, and we at joshuacody.net extend our most sincere apologies. And a tip o' the hat to <a href="http://twitter.com/jeff_goins">Jeff Goins</a> for the help.</p>
<p>Recently, <a href="http://mrgan.tumblr.com/post/304714649/favorite-music-2000s">Neven Mrgan</a> and <a href="http://armstrongcircus.com/blog/840/">Paul Armstrong</a> have both posted their best-of-the-decate music lists, and as I'd been thinking of doing my own for awhile, I figured I'd throw my hat in the ring as well. Neven makes a great point:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>I don’t trust my brain. Sure, it keeps me vertical most of the time, it tells me when I’m hungry, and I let it take care of the water bill. But ask it what my favorite music of the last decade was, and you’ll get a lot of hogwash comprising a neat mix of popular tunes, obscure concept albums, and hipster honor badges.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nonetheless, I'm not going to go the iTunes most-played route. It's not an accurate representation of what I listened to on various other devices and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc">compact discs</a> in the last 10 years. Oh, and bear in mind, I was a 12-year-old when this decade began. It should go without saying that my list will be backloaded, unless you want albums like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tubthumper">Chumbawumba's Tubthumping</a>.</p>
<p>Without further ado, with brief explanations appended, my favorite albums of the aughts.</p>
<h3>Copeland&mdash;Beneath Medicine Tree</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.lala.com/#album/1657606138229293178/Copeland/Beneath_Medicine_Tree"><img src="/images/blog-img/copeland.jpg" alt="Beneath Medicine Tree" width="200" height="200" class="center" /></a></p>
<p>Written during a particularly grueling period in lead singer Aaron Marsh's life, Beneath Medicine Tree deals extensively with hospitals, pain, and death. But at the end of it all, hope remains. Songs on this album pulled me through both the hospitalization of family members and the angst of late-teen romance. (And when you're a teenager, it's hard to tell which is worse.) Here's one particular verse that served as the anthem for plenty of walks in downtown Atlanta with myself and Caroline:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Through the night
    <br />
    We were waiting for a sign
    <br />
    Maybe rendered in the darkened sky
    <br />  
    Drawn by imaginary lines
    <br />
    Connecting radiant points of light
    <br />
    (please don't go)
    <br />
    Cause you showed up with your hair down
    <br />
    I might not sleep tonight</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>The National&mdash;Boxer</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.lala.com/#album/1225260573704657742/The_National/Boxer"><img src="/images/blog-img/national.jpg" alt="Boxer" width="200" height="200" class="center" /></a></p>
<p>This one wouldn't likely make any other best-of-the-decade lists. Most folks wouldn't even consider it the best album by The National. But, for me, there's something beautiful and dark about "Fake Empire" that reminds me of a very particular season in my life. Even more, standing at a particular place and thinking a particular thing. The tone of the entire album is sheer perfection for a summer night in the city.</p>
<h3>Brand New&mdash;The Devil and God Are Raging Inside Me</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.lala.com/#album/432627039263933890/Brand_New/The_Devil_And_God_Are_Raging_Inside_Me"><img src="/images/blog-img/brandnew.jpg" alt="The Devil and God are Raging Inside Me" width="200" height="200" class="center" /></a></p>
<p>If you hadn't noticed by the title, this is a difficult album. I'll quote effusively to prove my point:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I used to be such a burning example,
<br />
I used to be so original.
<br />
I used to care, I was being cared for.
<br />
Made sure I showed it to those that I love.</p>

<p>I used to sleep without a single stir,
<br />
'Cause I was about my father's work.</p>

<p>Well take me out tonight,
<br />
This ship of fools I'm on will sink.
<br />
A millstone around my neck,
<br />
Be my breath, there's nothing I wouldn't give.</p>

<p>I used to pray like God was listening.
<br />
I used to make my parents proud.
<br />
I was the glue that kept my friends together,
<br />
Now they don't talk and we don't go out.</p>

<p>I used to know the name of every person I'd kissed.
<br />
Now I made this bed and I can't fall asleep in it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No album of the decade so powerfully captured the human condition and the problem of evil. It drags you through the <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/10/18/national/main2101044.shtml">death of a seven-year-old girl</a> at the hands of a drunk driver, the loss of innocence, and failed relationships. Even redemption is framed as fear and hopelessness:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>I know you're coming in the night like a thief
    <br />
    But I've had some time, O Lord, to hone my lying technique
    <br />
    I know you think that I'm someone you can trust
    <br />
    But I'm scared I'll get scared and I swear I'll try to nail you back up</p>    
    <p>So do you think that we could work out a sign
    So I'll know it's you and that it's over so I won't even try</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, The Devil and God Are Raging Inside of Me reflects life for all of us at some time or another. Certainly not the most enjoyable album of the decade, but definitely the most sobering.</p>
<h3>Explosions in the Sky&mdash;The Earth is Not a Cold, Dead Place</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.lala.com/#album/5620773809945212824/Explosions_In_The_Sky/The_Earth_Is_Not_a_Cold_Dead_Place"><img src="/images/blog-img/explosions.jpg" alt="The Earth is Not a Cold, Dead Place" width="200" height="200" class="center" /></a></p>
<p>If you know me (no, really know me), then you are aware of my musical shortcomings. If you do not know me, then you should know, I have musical shortcomings. And not just any. We're talking borderline <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amusia">amusia</a> here. So it's no small feat that the entire instrumental <em>The Earth is Not a Cold, Dead Place</em> was able to impress me. I'd love to give more effusive praise for its melody, pitch, instrumentation, and musical perfection, but I'll leave that to people with two fully-functional ears.</p>
<h3>The Decemberists&mdash;Picaresque</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.lala.com/#album/2017894108902068380/The_Decemberists/Picaresque"><img src="/images/blog-img/decemberists.jpg" alt="Picaresque" width="200" height="200" class="center" /></a></p>
<p>Picaresque is a literati's musical dream. It's <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Candide/Voltaire/e/9781593080280/">Candide</a> set to music, the perfect example of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picaresque">picaresque</a>. You'll learn words you never knew you never knew (hat tip to last decade's Pocahontas) and get wrapped up in eleven beautiful acts that make up a nearly-perfect whole. My favorite story of the album climaxes thusly:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Meet me on my vast veranda 
    <br />
    My sweet, untouched Miranda 
    <br />
    And while the seagulls are crying 
    <br />
    We fall but our souls are flying</p></blockquote>
<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;And each of the eleven songs are equally epic and perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Around a year ago, <a href="http://twitter.com/kevinhendricks">Kevin Hendricks</a> posted a simple question on Twitter asking for recommendations of methods to back up your Twitter updates. He wanted an automatic and local solution&mdash;a man wise enough to realize users don't make backups when they have to put thought into it (cf. Apple's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Machine_(Apple_software)">Time Machine</a>).</p>
<p>Aptly, I can't find his question today. And since I couldn't find that, <a href="http://joshuacody.net/archive">I built this</a>.</p>
<p>Essentially, it cycles through my Twitter updates every 10 minutes, stores any new information in a database, then displays that information in a searchable manner. Nothing too fancy. </p>
<p>But let's talk more about why.</p>
<h3>A slight rant on search and pagination</h3>
<p>Looking for Kevin's year-old update exposes the shortcomings of Twitter's history.</p>
<p>Twitter's <a href="http://search.twitter.com">own search function</a> has only a 10-day memory. Alternately, I could paginate through his last 3200 updates, which they allow access to. Twitter's AJAX pagination, however, makes this experience fall somewhere between a headache and a disaster. The feature [sic] means the page doesn't have to reload when you click "more," but it also means that the URL contains no clue to where in the search results you are.</p>
<p>For example's sake, navigate to a user's page. <a href="http://twitter.com/jpcody">Mine will do just fine</a>. Now say you have hit "more" 100 times, which means a single page holds 2,000 results. But the URL still reads as <em>http://twitter.com/jpcody</em>. And should you navigate away, experience a browser crash, or accidentally hit the "Back" button of your browser, all your clicking and scrolling is lost. When you return to the page, you only get the 20 most recent updates for said user.</p>
<p>Then you cuss, your children hear, they repeat the words at school, and Twitter has landed you back in the principal's office.</p>
<h3>So you built this just to search?</h3>
<p>Not completely, although that's certainly a part of it. It <strong>is</strong> nice to be able to simply search "allanwhite" when I'm looking for something I remember saying to him back in September.</p>
<p>More importantly, I built it because Twitter doesn't exactly have a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter#Outages">sparkling track record</a>. Not even <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/12/17/twitter-reportedly-hacked-by-iranian-cyber-army/">within the last week</a>. And I don't trust my data in their hands.</p>
<p>Jeff Atwood recently experienced a nearly entire loss of his site, Coding Horror, and <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001315.html">had this to say in its wake</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Don't rely on your host or anyone else to back up your important data. Do it yourself. If you aren't personally responsible for your own backups, they are effectively not happening.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not to be a doomsayer, but Twitter could die. It's part of life for any service, bird, or application. There are malicious people out there with fast computers and an appetite for destruction. There are also brain farts, server errors, and lacks in foresight. It's just life on the internet.</p>
<p>Least of all, it's fun to be able to easily navigate to <a href="http://joshuacody.net/archive/index.php/archives/index/2450">my first musings</a> and see what I was saying back then. At this point, I haven't hit the magical number of 3200, so I could retrieve all of my updates (and still link to them on Twitter, should I choose). And now, my first 3200 will be stored on my own server, so even when I pass this upper-limit, I'll be able to access them at <em>http://joshuacody.net/twitter</em>.</p>
<p>(And, my server space and databases are backed up nightly to my personal machine, which is backed up to rotating hard drives, so I can really, really keep my data.)</p>
<h3>All this for some stupid Twitter updates?</h3>
<p>Yes, with a caveat.</p>
<p>Most people are guilty of a hasty generalization with Twitter. It's still commonly assumed that it's a place to "type what you ate for breakfast." (This fallacy comes in other packages as well, but it's the one tossed about most often.)</p>
<p>But I don't view it as such.</p>
<p class="big_quote">Twitter is a big corner of my online life where I store drafts of ideas, links to things I love, and snapshots of moments in time.</p>
<p>It's where I've learned the most about editing, the power of brevity, and the real-world value of sharing information. I can look back through my corner and see where I was a year ago&mdash;the things I was linking to, the way I was writing, or the pictures I was uploading. I can see where I was wrong and what I would do differently. And yeah, I've even said things that, to me, were wise enough or clever enough to keep.</p>
<h3>The future</h3>
<p>I'm thinking and brainstorming of ways to make this available to other folks. If it's something that'd be useful to you, then please follow me and retweet the following message:</p>
<p>I'm kidding. But let me know on Twitter or via email, and if it's something enough folks are interested in, I'll put some time and effort there.</p>

    		<p>As an enduring nostalgist, this <a href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/09/17/the-referendum/">New York Times Piece</a> affected me deeply. Tim Krieder examines middle-age and its accompanying feelings of helplessness. I read a lot of myself here, from his comically poignant views on children:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Most of my married friends now have children, the rewards of which appear to be exclusively intangible and, like the mysteries of some gnostic sect, incommunicable to outsiders. In fact it seems from the outside as if these people have joined a dubious cult: they claim to be much happier and more fulfilled than ever before, even though they live in conditions of appalling filth and degradation, deprived of the most basic freedoms and dignity, and owe unquestioning obedience to a capricious and demented master.</p>
    <p>I have never even idly thought for a single passing second that it might make my life nicer to have a small, rude, incontinent person follow me around screaming and making me buy them stuff for the rest of my life.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>to his deeply sobering thoughts on eternity and reflection:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>The problem is, we only get one chance at this, with no do-overs. Life is, in effect, a non-repeatable experiment with no control. In his novel about marriage, “Light Years,” James Salter writes: “For whatever we do, even whatever we do not do prevents us from doing its opposite. Acts demolish their alternatives, that is the paradox.” Watching our peers’ lives is the closest we can come to a glimpse of the parallel universes in which we didn’t ruin that relationship years ago, or got that job we applied for, or got on that plane after all. It’s tempting to read other people’s lives as cautionary fables or repudiations of our own.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pursuing the delicate balance of judicious reflection and healthy perspective is difficult at best. My failures at achieving peace make me thankful and hopeful that, while we get no do-overs, this life is only the prelude. And it doesn't quite feel like home and peace and comfort and perfection because it's <em>not</em>. That's the hope that keeps the troubles of the world at bay.</p>

    		<p>You'll surely find yourself more fulfilled by <a href="http://evhead.com/2009/11/why-retweet-works-way-it-does.html">Evan Williams' explanation</a> than my own. Read on at your own peril.</p>
<h3>A quick primer on a new feature</h3>
<p>Twitter recently implemented a new "retweet" feature. They've created a system where a User A can click "retweet" when viewing User B's message. Then, all who follow User A will see User B's status update in their own timelines, displayed thusly:</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog-img/2009-11-18-retweet.jpg" width="420" height="59" class="center" /></p>
<p>So you get:</p>
<ul>
    <li>An unknown avatar</li>
    <li>A little icon (that feels pretty out-of-place to Twitter's aesthetic)</li>
    <li>A line break plus appended, "Retweeted by [user]"</li>
</ul>
<h3>Pitchforks are ready, and heads must roll</h3>
<p>This is true of mostly any major feature change. And I don't think the complainers are without reason. Here are some of the leading arguments against the new feature (partially drawn from <a href="http://outspokenmedia.com/social-media/twitters-new-retweet-feature-sucks/">this post</a> and partially from various other arguments aggregated over time):</p>
<ul>
    <li>Who is this person in my stream?!</li>
    <li>But I want to add some context!</li>
    <li>People should know it came from <strong>me</strong>!</li>
    <li>What was wrong with the way it was?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Whoa, guys! Wait a second!</h3>
<p>I should begin by saying I am not a big fan of "retweeting." Occasionally, it's certainly warranted, but for some folks, it's like Twitter crack. They just can't stop. Come up with something to say of your own, and if someone else has enough good things to say, suggest to your Twitter crowd that they follow that person.</p>
<p>That being said, let's take a look at some of the arguments against the new implementation, and let's work last to first.</p>
<p>Lots of folks are missing the way it was, which is all right. But creating an official protocol for this function allows for all sorts of applications—mobile, web, and desktop—to access it via the API and creates a more uniform experience for Twitter users. Additionally, redundancy issues abound. In the search feature, you can end up with the whole search query filled by messages prepended with "RT @username", and in your own timeline, five people might post the same update. And some people thought it'd be fun to take a crap in the sandbox. They figured out they could have people follow them, retweet some message a thousand times and win a neat prize. They got high-volume, low-value followers and empty mentions, and we got a broken Twitter.</p>
<p>It's hard to argue against native support. Many people would give me this point, but they're still up in arms about the implementation.</p>
<p>The loudest grumbles come in the form of users complaining that strangers are popping up in their timeline, and this offends on two fronts: the first, it is confusing, and the second, it's not immediately obvious who second-hand shared the update. I think this could definitely be done a little bit better. A mockup of one thing I think would improve the system is below.</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog-img/retweet2.jpg" width="420" height="164" class="center" />
&lt;p class="image_caption"&gt;This would use the <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%40jpcody">search-style reply images</a> to display who did the retweeting.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>I'd find this a bit of an improvement, <strong>but I do think the current, official system is better than the old system.</strong> The way things were, credit for the original poster was little-to-none. A small text-link that was subconsciously dismissed due to the prepended "RT @." Individuals coming up with content worth being shared deserve more credit than this. They deserve for their original content to be seen in its original format—next to their avatar, prepended by their username.</p>
<p>In unofficial retweet syntax, all of the credit goes to the one who re-posted the original message. And that's not right. (I will reiterate that I realize the original poster received a text link, but due to the frequency of the syntax, most of the time I found myself subliminally discarding this opening information.)</p>
<p>But, wait! You want to add context, too! Thus, you get about six thousand of these in your timeline as people look at add "context" and keep it under 140 characters:</p>
<p class="big_quote">RT @username blah blah blah blah blah // WOW! lolzzz!</p>
<p class="center">&mdash;or&mdash;</p>
<p class="big_quote">RT @username I wnt 2 th str &amp; thnk I sw Jn Gsslin frm Jn&amp;Kt+8! | kewl!</p>
<p>This isn't always the case, and sometimes people can add great context with limited characters. But do you want to really add context? Begin your message with "re: http://j.mp/link", linking to the original post and having 120 characters for <strong>real, thorough</strong> context.</p>
<h3>C'mon, put the pitchfork down.</h3>
<p>It's certainly not perfect, and the implementation has a ways to go. But it's a heck of a lot better than the old madness.</p>
<p>I haven't covered all of the complaints, and perhaps I've missed some glaring ones, but I think proper attribution and minimizing redundancy can trump any argument I could imagine.</p>
<p>My biggest complaint? It's not very easy to mute a compulsive retweeter. It's possible without <em>too</em> much clicking around, but it's certainly not readily obvious.</p>
<p>And I certainly plan to use it for those using the new feature gratuitously.</p>

<p>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;</p>
<p>Simply put, it's the best movie I've seen this year. Brilliantly written, directed, and designed, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0887912/">The Hurt Locker</a> strikes the perfect blend of pure adrenaline and introspection. It's a far cry from the feeble-minded and heavy-handed attempts to demonize or glorify the Iraq War, opting to take an honest look at the psychological effects—good, bad, and necessary—of modern warfare.</p>
<p>The story follows Sergeant William James (played by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Renner">Jeremy Renner</a>) through his tour in Iraq as a member of a U.S. Army Explosive Ordnance Disposal unit. He's sharp-witted, loyal, courageous, reckless, and everything in between, and Renner's performance captures his complexity perfectly—a refreshing break from the flat characters of so many war movies. Sergeant James focuses on neither past nor future; instead, he spends the movie being, and director <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathryn_Bigelow">Kathryn Bigelow</a> slowly reveals his depth. This is the crux of the entire movie, and the plot serves only to slowly disclose James to us, and in turn, the difficult lives of men like him. (And the possibly more difficult lives of those surrounding them.)</p>
<p>For me, its only shortcoming was sloppy and forced dialogue in a small handful of scenes. This was nothing more than a blip on the radar. Nitpicking.</p>
<p>All in all, the movie riveted me for 128 minutes, and I left exhausted and contemplative. You can't merely watch <em>The Hurt Locker</em>, looking for escape or a catharsis. You participate in it, and you leave thankful for those you love and deeply concerned about the flawed human condition.</p>

    <p>We all know that there's no [REDACTED] way in the world we should have microwave ovens and refrigerators and TV sets and everything else at the prices we're paying for them. There's no way we get all this stuff and everything is done fair and square and everyone gets treated right. No way. And don't be confused -- what we're talking about here is our way of life. Our standard of living. You want to "fix things in China," well, it's gonna cost you. Because everything you own, it's all done on the backs of millions of poor people whose lives are so awful you can't even begin to imagine them, people who will do anything to get a life that is a tiny bit better than the shitty one they were born into, people who get exploited and treated like shit and, in the worst of all cases, pay with their lives.</p>
