    		<p>Recently, I was reading an <a href="http://www.cultofmac.com/john-sculley-on-steve-jobs-the-full-interview-transcript/63295">interview with former Apple CEO John Sculley</a> on Steve Jobs. By far, my favorite snippet was this, as Sculley describes Jobs’ admiration for Dr. Edward Land, co-founder of Polaroid:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Both of them had this ability to not invent products, but discover products. Both of them said these products have always existed – it’s just that no one has ever seen them before. We were the ones who discovered them. The Polaroid camera always existed and the Macintosh always existed — it’s a matter of discovery.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It goes hand-in-hand with John Gruber’s description of Stanley Kubrick discovering the perfect camera angle in his wonderful talk, <a href="http://2010.dconstruct.org/speakers/john-gruber">The Auteur Theory of Design</a>.</p>

<p>Things already exist—perfect camera angles, ingenious product ideas, beautiful songs, new strategies. But we have to have patience and dedication, then put ourselves in positions to discover them.</p>

    		<p class="note"><strong>Foreword:</strong> This matter has rolled around in my head for no small amount of time now. We'll see if I can write about it aptly. I'd like to clarify that this is an indictment of myself before any others. It's a way of thinking and a struggle I've found myself wrapped in. And many, if not most, if not all, of the people who come to your mind during this reading are <strong>phenomenal</strong> people. I'm not criticizing any <strong>one person</strong> but a system in general. You may continue.</p>

<h3 id="the-church">The Church</h3>

<p>The economics of creating a version of a secular product and aiming it at churchgoers are alive and well. This used to be primarily t-shirts and sermon themes. These, thankfully, became passe and generally the subject of ridicule. Lately, something new seems to have emerged. I wouldn’t argue that it’s the same thing or spearheaded by the same people, but I’m starting to wonder if it’s equally silly.</p>

<p>I’m talking about Christian <a href="http://8bit.io/">blog networks</a>, Christian <a href="http://stuffchristianslike.net/">Stuff White People Like</a>, Christian conferences, et al. The market of “Christian” + [secular idea or product name] is alive and well, recession notwithstanding. Don’t listen to me, just note the 440,778 pixels of ad space on <a href="http://churchcrunch.com/weekly-top-commenters-7/">Christian TechCrunch</a>.</p>

<p><strong>An aside:</strong> Can we please stop using Christian as an adjective to describe inanimate objects. Your blog is not a Christian. Your book is not a Christian. I know it’s convenient and has become accepted usage, but maybe we could push away from that?</p>

<p>Moving along. We want to ask bold questions on our blog. We don’t want to be like the Christians that came before us. We want to be forward-thinking, break new ground, create conversations, tweetup, lead the social media revolution, and more. So we blog, and then other Christians comment on our blog. Or we create conferences, and other Christians attend our conferences.</p>

<p>We create a peer group completely isolated from those in the world who do not ascribe the term “Christian” to themselves.</p>

<h3 id="the-resistance">The Resistance</h3>

<p>If you haven’t read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/War-Art-Through-Creative-Battles/dp/0446691437">The War of Art</a>, you’re cheating yourself. In it, Steven Pressfield lays out a fairly simple thesis: <em>You were put on this earth for a purpose—to do some sort of work. And there is a force that opposes that work and manifests itself in a multitude of ways, which can be called <strong>Resistance</strong>.</em></p>

<p>He doesn’t make many assumptions about the particulars of what endows purpose or what is behind Resistance, but he does posit that both are spiritual issues. The Resistance can look like a lot of things: disorderly work spaces, distractions, unhealthy relationships, and so on and so forth. He’s actually fairly ruthless in his ascription of Resistance.</p>

<p>I’d argue that “Christian” things have become Resitance for Christians. It’s much easier to blog or attend conferences of like-minded individuals or start a Christian golf cart company than it is to go about our lives, spend time with people in some way unlike ourselves, and have constructive conversations about the power of the gospel of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>What if we mess up? What if we tell them Jesus loves them regardless of whatever shortcomings we perceive them to have, but then we find that we don’t love them? What if we are convicted about something? What if we just don’t like them? What if we become entangled in relationships to the point that we have to stop using <strong>we</strong> and <strong>them</strong> language, but we become them, and they become us? Will my friends from church still like me? What if I find out that in practice, my theology is wrong, and I have to change what I believe?</p>

<p>Those are hard questions. They’re scary questions. Know what’s not hard and scary? Christian golf carts.</p>

<h3 id="doing-your-work">Doing Your Work</h3>

<p>All things to all men, cultural sensitivity, relativity, effective communication. I know, I know. But I do find it hard to imagine that Jesus would spend precious seconds of his life firing up his Google Reader, clicking over to [insert blog name here], and commenting on whether iPads are going to be the future of church communication.</p>

<p>I’m a little averse to the idea of “What would Jesus do?” thing as a life choice metric as it assumes we know the correct answer to that question, so I don’t want you to put too much stock in the preceding paragraph. But we do need to ask ourself what <strong>we</strong> are to do.</p>

<p>I personally came to the realization that I was living in Resistance. My job was in a church. My writing was for a blog aimed at churches. My friends were from church. I was practically <a href="http://chickfila.com/">eating at a church</a>. But unless someone stumbled into the church I worked at or happened to stumble upon something I wrote, I wasn’t influencing or being influenced by people unlike myself. And when your work is to make disciples, that’s not a healthy balance.</p>

<p>So my big ask is that we stop trying to become the next big thing in Christian culture or create the next huge Christian blog or start the next giant conference. Let’s do stuff, then write about it later instead of just blogging.</p>

<p>Less talking, more doing. Instead of creating a new site focused on iPad applications for emerging Christian leaders of the next generation catalyst synergy, coach your kid’s soccer team. Make cookies for your coworkers. Consider supporting your neighborhood association instead of paying airfare plus hotel plus rental car plus meals plus conference tickets.</p>

<p>Re-evaluate what your work is and what it should be, and make sure the two align well.</p>

    	<div class="blog_body">		
    		<p>23 years ago today, a black sedan pulled into the parking lot of a nondescript brick building. The kind you see everywhere in the suburbs. Built at an indeterminable time between 1975 and 2000, faux columns, concrete stairs. You've seen them before.</p>
<p>The film flickers, the camera shakes, whispers become louder. The driver of the car approaches the rear, passenger-side door. Click. Creak. The camera drops. Now there is talking and shouting.</p>
<p class="big_quote">"It's Joshua!"</p>
<p class="big_quote">"Hold the camera, momma! No, no, take it, Steve!"</p>
<p>Feet shuffle. Nervous pacing becomes spirited jogging. The camera switches to a nausea-inducing view of pavement, but the tape records the laughter and tears and shouts.</p>
<p>You can't plan for moments like this. You think you'll film the whole thing. You think you'll hold the camera steady. But you're kidding yourself.</p>
<p>The moment you meet your child for the first time isn't a moment for planning, composure, and efficiency. It's not a moment that's filmed by Ken Burns and narrated by James Earl Jones. It's a moment filmed by dad and narrated by mom, both raptured a thousand times more than they expected when the back door opens.</p>
<h3>The Delivery</h3>
<p>This is the story of my birth.</p>
<p>I've watched the film time and time again. I've seen myself delivered from whatever unsure future I faced into the arms of loving and caring parents who wanted nothing more than happiness and success for me.</p>
<p>I've seen the beauty and power of adoption first-hand.</p>
<p>Before I was born, my father was born, in Ireland. Both his mother and father died, and he too was adopted—into the United States. Somehow, some way, out of an Irish orphanage and into a Massachusetts home. Were it not for adoption, I'd never be here.</p>
<p>Before my mother was born, her father was adopted. His mother died, and his father was a drunk who gave his sister away for a bottle of whiskey. Were it not for adoption, I'd never be here.</p>
<h3>The Friends</h3>
<p>Caroline and I have always had a soft spot for adoption and imagined it was part of our future. And in the last year, we've watched the <a href="http://twitter.com/lolaseay">Seays</a>, the <a href="http://babyvogeltanz.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/img_0205.jpg">Vogeltanzs</a>, the <a href="http://jonesfamilyadoption.com/blog/">Joneses</a>, the <a href="http://twitter.com/jasonlohse/status/10732548577">Lohses</a> and the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/monkeyouttanowhere/3407282933/in/photostream">Hendricks</a> either begin or end the adoption process.</p>
<p>We're beyond grateful to have such wonderful people in our lives—full of love and grace and humility. We believe in them, and we believe in their cause. We believe in their cause because we believe it's our cause and your cause. Adoption matters.</p>
<h3>The Plug</h3>
<p>Kevin Hendricks recently wrote <a href="http://www.kevindhendricks.com/books/adoption/"><em>Addition by Adoption</em></a>, an hilarious look at adoption, parenting, and life. Kevin is a stand-up guy and a great writer, and he and his wife, Abby, live out what they believe.</p>
<p>So the purposes of this little story and plug are twofold: one, to let you know about what Kevin is doing. And two, if you are considering adoption, I want to buy you a copy. So here's what to do:</p>
<p><strong>Ahem.</strong> The instructions used to be to comment, but they were from a previous version of this site where comments were in existence. But rest assured, a lucky soul received a copy of Kevin's book.</p>

    		<p>Efficiency is a friend to business and productivity, but it's an enemy of community. Trust and lasting relationships are built on the belief that the other party values <strong>you</strong> more than they value <strong>themselves</strong>.</p>

<p>And in order to truly value others, we set aside our schedules and plans. We let our coffee meetings run to two hours. We spontaneously drive an hour to Sonic. We take an hour on the phone even though we have a thousand other things to do.</p>

<p>If you're trying to keep your community efficient, you're depriving yourselves and those around you. Relationships are inefficient, but they're worth it.</p>

    		<p>Caroline and I are staying at a hotel in San Diego to get a three-day break from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland,_Oregon#Climate">winter in Portland</a>. We fly for nearly free thanks to parents at Delta, I can work from the road, and we scored a great deal on our accommodations on <a href="http://priceline.com">Priceline</a>. Despite the good price, I'd never stay here again, but I'm not going to complain about it.</p>
<p>The guest representative let us know the airport shuttle would arrive in ten minutes, but it took an hour. I have called the front desk multiple times with no answer. Our bed smells like tacky perfume. The sink leaks to the bathroom floor. None of these things are major, but they add up. And, based on my experience as in high school statistics, four problems are not an anomaly, they are systemic.</p>
<h3>Dang man, tell them!</h3>
<p>I won't mention it. I'm not the complaining type. I tend to eschew conflict where possible, try not to be disruptive, and worry that I'm simply being a pain <sup id="2010_02_15_fnlink1"><a href="#2010_02_15_fn1">1</a></sup>. I'm having a great time with my wife exploring a new city, and I have better things to do than fight with an underpaid, overworked hotel manager.</p>
<p>But I'll never be back.</p>
<p>This is where it's important to use your own service, personally solicit feedback, get things right the first time, and fix problems before people ever complain. For every guest, customer, or individual who complains, there are plenty who don't. Who you'll never get back. Who are costing you money.</p>
<h3>So what? You just got it on <a href="http://priceline.com">Priceline</a>.</h3>
<p>Every customer is just as valuable as another. Whether they are providing profit or helping to cut the loss, they're doing you a favor by choosing your organization. Whether they're using <a href="http://nightly.webkit.org/">Webkit nightly builds</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer_7">Internet Explorer</a>, they're still a customer. Never become of the mind that one customer is more valuable than another. They're customers, and they're serving you. It's your job to give them the best possible experience.</p>
<p>If you're married to utilitarianism, then think of it this way: You don't know how frequently any given customer will return. You don't know their network and influence. You don't know when and where they'll review your organization. And as a business-owner, you can't afford to take a chance that their impact will be disproportionate to their price point.</p>
<h3>Too negative, shut up.</h3>
<p>All right, how about this? Same trip story.</p>
<p>My wife and I had lunch at <a href="http://chickfila.com/">Chick-fil-a</a> here in San Diego. And some friends here in San Diego were so gracious to drive us&mdash;us being without a car and all. We ordered lunch for ourselves and friends, and one of the eight total items we ordered was not ready at the same time as the others.</p>
<p>They graciously informed us that they'd bring the sandwich to our table when it was ready. We didn't complain. No big deal. But when they brought it, they brought a coupon for a free meal along with it.</p>
<p>Later in the day, after our friends were gone, we took our coupon, bought two bus passes, and rode 30 minutes back to Chickfila.</p>
<p>Now <strong>that</strong> is how you proactively address problems and build intense loyalty.</p>
<ol>
    <li id="2010_02_15_fn1">I'm framing this trait positively. It's not without its downfalls of problems that grow unnecessarily large, miscommunications, and avoidable relational pain. <a href="#2010_02_15_fnlink1" class="small_caps">&nbsp;&nbsp;[Jump back]</a></li>

    		<p>Those of you who know me are likely to know I've been on the job hunt for awhile now. Little was changing for about seven months, and it was getting fairly discouraging. Unfortunately, the temptation to define our value based on external validation is part of the human condition. It just happens. But then, two-weeks-ago happened.</p>
<p>Between Tuesday and Wednesday, I received three job offers. I was on the verge of making my decision Sunday when another organization called to ask me to come in that afternoon for a pitch. Seven months unemployed, I had four people to give a final decision on Monday.</p>
<h3>Why I Said That Stuff</h3>
<p>This isn't an exercise in hubris. I was obviously unemployable for seven months; I would like to emphasize that. Some days I considered going out and applying for jobs that would have likely rendered me fairly unhappy. It's not fun to watch <a href="http://twitter.com/carolinecody">your wife</a> work her tail off for five months while you freelance, look for jobs, and eat kettle chips.</p>
<p>But in those seven months, I pursued something I love. I tried things. I tried lots of different things. I learned the niche that I learned that I loved within the thing that I learned that I loved. I found people who were amazing at the thing that I learned that I loved and the niche that I learned that I loved within the thing that I learned that I loved.</p>
<p>I read. I worked. I <a href="http://joshuacody.net/portfolio">created things to work on</a> when people weren't paying me to work. I thought. I wrote. I thought some more. I tried not to incessantly refresh <a href="http://cnn.com">cnn.com</a> and <a href="http://espn.com">espn.com</a>. I waitied. I wrote about what I thought and why I thought it.</p>
<p>And then I had the amazing opportunity to say no to three people.</p>
<p>But even more, I had the opportunity to say yes to <a href="http://qworky.com">Qworky</a>.</p>
<h3>What I'll be doing</h3>
<p>Well, Qworky has a product. It's a product that's going to be a pretty big help to a lot of people. A product I believe in. A product that will have a website as soon as I finish making it. And Qworky has a team. A team of smart guys and girls who really believe in the product, genuinely care about people, and are smart as a whip.</p>
<p>I'll be the <strong>QX Developer</strong>, which is short for Qworky Experience Developer. I'll be taking their product and helping them make it a dream for you to use. Taking every hurdle possible that's between you and your work and leave it crying in the corner. Helping you get from waking up to doing what you love to not doing what you love and instead doing what you love to do outside of work.</p>
<p>I'll be doing a little freelancing for some time, wrapping up old projects and perhaps starting some new ones. But mostly, I'll be thinking about experiences, which thrills me to no end. I'll leave my nose in articles such as <a href="http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?968">this</a>, <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/the-problem-with-passwords/">this</a>, and <a href="http://52weeksofux.com/post/385981737/the-usage-lifecycle">this</a>. I'll work from <a href="http://stumptowncoffee.com/locations/downtown">here</a>. And I'll get one of <a href="http://images.google.com/images?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=german%20shorthaired%20pointer&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;sa=N&amp;hl=en&amp;tab=wi">these</a>.</p>
<p>I feel fortunate and inspired that so many people who know me prayed for me, thought of me, connected me with opportunities, and truly cared for me. I feel grateful that I have a wife who worked so hard and waited so patiently while her husband sought his passion.</p>
<p>But most of all, I feel encouraged, and I hope you do too, that hard work, dedication, risks, and dreams still lead to great promise and opportunities. I hope you'll take these words as a challenge and encouragement to find and do whatever you love. To surround yourself with great people. And to live a fuller life.</p>

And previously, on the iPhone. But they're framing this discussion in the wrong way.</p>
<h3>Apple can't do multitasking</h3>
<p>For some reason, this is how the debate is framed. "Apple can't figure it out." "The processor isn't powerful enough." "No multitaskz?! Apple FAIL!!11!."</p>
<p>The fundamental issue here isn't that Apple can't figure out how to offer multitasking or can't come up with the technology for it. The technology community keeps having that discussion again and again.</p>
<p>The real issue is that Apple doesn't want multitasking. Apple, like <a href="http://www.davecrenshaw.com/the-myth-of-multitasking.php">Dave Crenshaw</a>, knows something that most of us are too stubborn to concede. <strong>Multitasking causes problems.</strong></p>
<h3>Problems? What problems?</h3>
<p>For the casual user, multiple simultaneous applications present a paradigm problem. The model is abstracted too much. You have an application, in which you have a window (many times abstracted further by tabs), in which you have the tasks you wish to complete. At any given point, you might have zero windows open or one thousand windows open. Either situation brings confusion.</p>
<p>For the power user, multiple simultaneous applications present a paradigm problem. Too often I end up with this:</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog-img/2010-02-05-toomany.jpg" alt="Too many applications" width="430" height="269" class="center" /></p>
<p>Just before I end up with this:</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog-img/2010-02-05-psquit.jpg" alt="Photoshop Quit" width="430" height="168" class="center" /></p>
<p>Or I end up with this:</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog-img/2010-02-05-toowide.jpg" alt="Too Wide" width="430" height="85" class="center" /></p>
<p>All of which are confusing and irritating situations for me. I can imagine this is only exacerbated if someone is simply a casual computer user or new to computing altogether.</p>
<h3>A better way</h3>
<p>Apple, however, implicitly proposes a solution.</p>
<p>Allow multitasking. But by making switching applications just as simple as running multiple applications at the same time.</p>
<p>You want to multitask with applications? Just close one, open the other, and the SDK will allow developers to automatically save your state. System-level cut, copy, and paste also mean you can easily transfer text and images between applications.</p>
<p>Now, you no longer have to deal with multiple applications being open, memory being eaten by tasks you're unaware of, or crashes from too many things going on at once.</p>
<p>If each of my applications would open via a simple process in a near-instant, my need for multiple applications would be nearly obliterated.</p>
<p>Not <strong>completely</strong> though. From time-to-time I need to split windows like this:</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog-img/2010-02-05-splitscreen.jpg" alt="Split screen windows" width="430" height="269" class="center" /></p>
<p>And I consider some of my utilities that run in the background as non-negotiables (looking at you <a href="http://code.google.com/p/blacktree-alchemy/">Quicksilver</a>, <a href="http://www.smileonmymac.com/TextExpander/">TextExpander</a>, <a href="http://agilewebsolutions.com/products/1Password">1Password</a>, and <a href="http://droplr.com/hello">Droplr</a>.)</p>
<p>But you know who doesn't? Your mom. Or the average user.</p>
<p>Apple isn't looking to replace your MacBook Pro. Or your Mac Pro. Perhaps OS 11 will take things in the direction of the iPhone OS, but I hope not, and I doubt it.</p>
<p>What they've done is made a consumer-level machine that removes abstractions. No application/window/tabs/tasks model. No mouse and click model. No desktop metaphor.</p>
<p>It's not a failure. Or a misstep. Or a dealbreaker. It's just not a computer for you and your creative power. But for John Doe, the iPad is the future of computing.</p>

    		<p>In a <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/jnack/2009/12/rt_illustration_moby-dick.html">link roundup</a> over a month ago, John Nack from Adobe linked thusly:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p><a href="http://bit.ly/90bmx7">How to make dotted borders in Photoshop</a>. (Not hard, but we should simplify the process.) [<a href="http://twitter.com/thinsoldier">Via</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And on Twitter, he said essentially the same thing, although not in the link roundup context:</p>
<blockquote><p>How to make dotted borders in Photoshop: <a href="http://bit.ly/90bmx7">http://bit.ly/90bmx7</a> (Not hard, but we should simplify it.) (via <a href="http://twitter.com/thinsoldier">@thinsoldier</a>)</p></blockquote>
<p>This didn't sit right with me, but I wasn't sure how to communicate what I was feeling. Sitting here today, with who knows what inspiration, it hit me.</p>
<p class="big_quote">In interfaces and systems, you should treat users like they're dumb. In conversations, this should never be the case.</p>
<p>Simplify your experiences, then simplify them some more. Provide simple assistance along the way. Any time users have to ask for help or misunderstand something, that's your fault, not theirs. Your experiences should aim to be intuitive and simple for <em>anyone</em> that you would like to use them.</p>
<p>This trick, shared by Jesse Bennett-Chamberlain, was making the rounds because it was a significant help to Photoshop users. No one at Adobe should write this off as, "not hard." Obviously, it is hard. And that's their problem, not the users'.</p>

    		<p>Lately, I've been particularly impressed by the idea that actual market saturation is a point much higher than I would anticipate. More simply, the sandbox is a lot bigger than I realized.</p>
<p>I tend to think, "Oh, someone is already doing X, so I need to think of something new." More and more, I'm realizing how wrong I am.</p>
<p>I'm coming to a point where I want to <em>recognize my main competitors as my best contributors</em>.</p>
<h3>The iPad Again</h3>
<p>I think Microsoft misses the boat here with their reality distortion field around Apple products. I'll include a couple of quotes that come to mind:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Watson claimed that many developers of applications for the iPhone OS–which the iPad uses–are not making money. Developing applications for the iPhone and iPad is expensive, he said, because iPhone OS uses the Objective-C language rather than Microsoft’s more pervasive .NET platform. And Apple’s control over the platform has alienated some people that make software for its products, he said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="quote_caption">Brandon Watson, Microsoft Director of Product Management, on the iPad (via <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2010/01/29/msft-ipad">Daring Fireball</a>)</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>There's no chance that the iPhone is going to get any significant market share. No chance. It's a $500 subsidized item. They may make a lot of money. But if you actually take a look at the 1.3 billion phones that get sold, I'd prefer to have our software in 60% or 70% or 80% of them, than I would to have 2% or 3%, which is what Apple might get.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="quote_caption">Steve Ballmer on the iPhone (via <a href="http://www.electronista.com/articles/07/04/30/ballmer.on.iphone/">Electronista</a>)</p>
<p>I think Microsoft displays an old model of business here. Armchair analysis and hours of watching <a href="http://www.amctv.com/originals/madmen/">Mad Men</a> confirm that this practice took hold as marketing and advertising rose to greater prominence with the television. If you could tell everyone why that other brand of adult undergarments was underperforming<sup id="2010_01_29_fnlink3"><a href="#2010_01_29_fn3">1</a></sup>, then they would select your brand by default.</p>
<h3>A different, better mindset</h3>
<p>But are these really the customers you want? The kind who just blindly believe you that the other guy is less good? And further, in this age where reviews are so accessible, your press release or off-hand public quote carry little value.</p>
<p>Instead, praise innovation. Praise your competitors. Assure your customers that you're excited that the bar is raised and you can't wait to deliver an even better product with these new ideas and some of your own.</p>
<p>There is more than enough room for two creators of operating systems. There is more than enough room for another concrete company, coffee shop, or whatever you're passionate about. But build on the work of your competitors, praise what they're doing, and make yourself better in some way. That's where success lives.</p>

    		<p>Earlier today, <a href="http://twitter.com/nevenmrgan">Neven Mrgan</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/siracusa">John Siracusa</a> were having a little chat about the adequacy of the <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2010/01/various_ipad_thoughts">automatic and manual transmission metaphor</a> making the rounds in the iPad context.</p>
<p>If you don't know Neven<sup id="2010_01_29_fnlink1"><a href="#2010_01_29_fn1">1</a></sup>, he's a bright and kind guy. But given his brightness, he tends to disagree with people online sometimes. Particularly, the aforementioned conversation and the occasional banter with <a href="http://twitter.com/hotdogsladies">Merlin Mann</a>. And when he disagrees, he wants to keep it nice. So he adds a colon-parenthases emoticon<sup id="2010_01_29_fnlink2"><a href="#2010_01_29_fn2">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Over time, this gets awkward, and it brought me to a simple realization, which I shall call Neven's Law. It can ring true of Twitter, online chatting, and email. Essentially, any digital, written communication:</p>
<p class="big_quote">The appropriateness of a medium is inversely proportional to the number of emoticons necessary in a given discussion.</p>
<p>Now, I appreciate them having these conversations in public so the masses can participate. But now that we have a law, perhaps we can apply it and bump these conversations up to the easiest-possible theater where emoticons are no longer necessary. </p>
<p>Or, we can continue with our emoticons&mdash;using them as clues for the audience that, "this would be better said elsewhere." But there you have it. Now go forth with your new knowledge and continue discussing.</p>

    		<p>The iPad has generated lots of discussion about computing metaphors, computer interactions, and general technology. Of course, there's been plenty of the usual banter as the masses decry the closed platform, the evils of the App Store, the lack of an optical drive, and so on and so forth. That's to be expected of anything worth discussing.</p>
<h3>Creation and Consumption</h3>
<p>But I'm particularly intrigued at the discussion of creation versus consumption circling around <a href="http://al3x.net/2010/01/28/ipad.html">Alex Payne</a>, <a href="http://joshuablankenship.com/blog/2010/01/28/on-the-ipad-for-serious-this-time/">Joshua Blankenship</a>, <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2010/01/27/iPad">Tim Bray</a>, and <a href="http://createdigitalmusic.com/2010/01/27/how-a-great-product-can-be-bad-news-apple-ipad-and-the-closed-mac/">Peter Kirn</a>. The first two gentlemen, in particular, are men who create things that make me want to <strong>a) be better</strong> and <strong>b) give up because I'll never match them</strong>.</p>
<p>Joshua Blankeship had this to say:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>But the iPad is not designed to fill my desire to create, it’s mainly designed for me to consume the creations of others. It will change the landscape of personal computing and find its way into the hands of a ridiculous amount of people who are very happy to simply consume. My hands just won’t be among them anytime soon. I have too much creating to do.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He's a careful, caring guy. But I think he goes a bit too far here with his tone towards this machine.</p>
<p>The folks I've seen discussing this are in two fields&mdash;design and development. Ten inches of screen real estate and no physical keyboard aren't right for <em>their type of creation.</em> But for other creators, I think this device can really hit the sweet spot; especially at $499. Let's look at a few ways this could help creators:</p>
<h3>Types of Creators</h3>
<p><strong>Writers.</strong> Imagine <a href="http://www.ommwriter.com/">Ommwriter</a> on this thing, with the physical keyboard dock. You've got a 10-inch machine, capable and portable, that's <em>perfect</em> for writing extended works. Additionally, no multi-tasking has the benefit of no distractions. It's also nice for people who need to create short-form content on the road: bloggers, copywriters, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Photographers and designers.</strong> At $499, this would be a great second machine for creatives. Your portfolio, wireframes, sketches, etc. It's portability is key here. As a second machine, you could easily sketch things here as you spoke with a client, giving them visual feedback and brainstorming. And it works anywhere. Whiteboards are gigantic, and laptops are feature-rich. It's certainly a nice-to-have.</p>
<p><strong>Leaders.</strong> With iBooks and portability, a device like this can give leaders the flexibility to inspire and challenge others as they go about creating environments and cultures. I know plenty of leaders who <strong>love</strong> their netbook because it lets them do what they need and create what they need on the go. I'm confident the iPad will only work better for this audience.</p>
<p><strong>Learners.</strong> Creators are, by nature, learners. On your person, you can have <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Elements-Style-Fourth-William-Strunk/dp/020530902X">The Elements of Style</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Elements-Typographic-Style-Robert-Bringhurst/dp/0881791326">The Elements of Typographic Style</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">Wikipedia</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cormac_McCarthy#Published_works">A Cormac McCarthy novel</a>, your favorite photographer's entire portfolio, and anything else you need. There is a certain paralysis that comes with too much information, but there is also a certain freedom. I'd never be where I am today without the wealth of information made available online and the democratization of knowledge.</p>
<h3>The Takeaway</h3>
<p>I'm right with the spirit of what some of those before me have said. Creators have to constantly fight the battle of consumption paralysis. And ravenous consumption will inhibit the progress of many would-be creators.</p>
<p>And this device isn't geared for heavy-duty creation. But it can certainly help some people continue creating with more flexibility.</p>
<p>And what of consumption? Everyone consumes; it's inevitable. But it's not up to Apple what you consume. It's up to you.</p>

    		<p>Someone starts a vision with a vision, a dream, and a passion.</p>
<p>They want to provide quality healthcare to individuals. They want to put financial advice in the hands of young people moving into adulthood. They want to deliver news and opinions to the curious and entrepreneurial reader.</p>
<p>At what point do companies like these stop caring about users? How do these visionaries live with phone systems as daunting and frustrating as navigating across the Atlantic? How do these dreamers accept customer service policies that leave customers shouldering the burden and scrambling?</p>
<p class="big_quote">At some point, the people at the top of companies stop making innovations and start making excuses.</p>
<p>"We provide better service than some of our competitors."</p>
<p>"We're working as quickly as possible to upgrade our network."</p>
<p>"It's because potential customers are ignorant of our value."</p>
<p>Bull. It's because you've lost your way. You used to be passionate and <em>focused on your dream</em>. Now you're <em>focused on your bottom-line</em>, and you've lost your desire for meaning and perfection.</p>
<h3>A simple charge</h3>
<p>Make it easy for people to use your product or service. Shoulder every possible burden for your consumer. Let them talk to humans instead of machines. Make their interactions with you a <em>pleasure</em> instead of a <em>burden</em>.</p>
<p>Eventually, you just might end up with <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/technology/ByteOfTheApple/blog/archives/2010/01/almost_40_billi.html">$40 billion on hand</a>.</p>
<p>What, you want 10 ways? All right.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Send them email updates instead of making them log in</li>
    <li>Have a human answer your phone line in less than four rings, guaranteed.</li>
    <li>Whenever someone complains, give them something free, and send a hand-written apology letter.</li>
    <li>Pay someone to be in charge of your user experience online. Someone good.</li>
    <li>Let people login to your site with their email address.</li>
    <li>Have your executives answer phone calls and emails personally, for two hours each week.</li>
    <li>Apologize, early and often. Your customers are right, and you're wrong.</li>
    <li>Actively engage in social media. Don't bother with an account if it's not personal or interactive.</li>
    <li>Let users choose a charity to donate 5% of their sale to.</li>
    <li>Give random customers something free. Every 500th customer gets a gift card. Something like that. Don't publicize it, just do it.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are the things that make your dream a pleasure to use. And when you don't do them, eventually, people find something else that <em>is</em> a pleasure.</p>

    		<p>In the vein of <a href="http://joshuacody.net/blog/on_disappointment">disappointment</a>, I have another question: Where are you setting your expectations? I think for most of us, the answer to that question is, "too low."</p>
<p>When you're investing in something, or more particular, someone, set your expectations high. You're investing in them because you see potential. And they're allowing you to invest in them because they believe you can cultivate that potential.</p>
<p>When you let them off the hook with half-ass work, you're doing them a disservice. It's easy for us to say, "That's all right, everyone fails sometimes." And there is certainly a time for it to be said. But more often, we should be saying, "Go back and do it better." If you prefer, you can preface it with "Good work."</p>
<p>It might come off as insensitive, but in the end, higher expectations mean better results. Whether you're in the business of creating products, delivering services, or developing individuals, that's a win-win situation.</p>
<p>When it comes to people, expect work, products, and character just a little bit better than you have ever seen from them before.</p>

<p>Always. So when you're feeling disappointed, ask yourself two questions:</p>
<ul>
	<li>What expectations were communicated that went unmet?</li>
	<li>What expectations were assumed, although never communicated?</li>
</ul>
<p>And when you're feeling angry, sad, or irritated? Ask yourself if what you <strong>actually</strong> are is disappointed.</p>

    		<p>Recently, I feel like I've been witness to a few too many ideas passing me by. Not passing me by for a lack of merit or an innate implausibility, but passing me by because my passion wanes.</p>
<p>I'm still wrestling with whether this is simply the nature of ideas or I rested on my laurels for too long. And I don't think it's an answer that will come easily.</p>
<p>But the point remains. In language that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/War-Art-Through-Creative-Battles/dp/0446691437">Steven Pressfield</a> would approve of: when you've put yourself in the right position, and the muse is ready to touch you, you'd better be ready to throw everything else aside and chase her. She won't last long.</p>
<p>Jason Fried of 37 Signals <a href="http://www.vimeo.com/4717683?pg=embed&amp;sec=">said the same thing</a> much more eloquently in 2009 (excuse the huge quote wall, but it's <em>that</em> good):</p>
<blockquote><p>Inspiration is perishable. We all have ideas, and once you have the idea, the idea is sort of immortal. It lives on forever; it goes on forever. The idea exists, even if it's just in your head or you write it down, it's happened. But what isn't going to last forever is your inspiration for that idea. Inspirations are like fresh fruit, like milk—they have an expiration date, and they don't last very long.</p>
<p>If you happen to be lucky enough and fortunate enough to be inspired to do something, you've got to do it right now because every day you go, it gets browner and browner and deader and starts to rot and goes away. Inspiration is perishable, you can not hang on to it. So if you find something you want to do, you've just got to go out and do it.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you're in the business of creating, you'd better be ready to move quick. Nothing gold can stay.</p>

    		<p>The New York Times reported today that The New York Times will begin <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/21/business/media/21times.html?src=twt&amp;twt=nytimesglobal">charging users for online access</a> after viewing a yet-to-be-determined number of free articles.</p>
<p>A quick Twitter search for "new york times" yields 15 first-page results&mdash;8 of which are negative reactions to this idea. (How's that for a scientific way of determining the pulse of the nation? Move over Anderson Cooper, I'm an iReporter.)</p>
<p>From the article about the plan:</p>
<blockquote><p>But executives of The New York Times Company said they could not yet answer fundamental questions about the plan, like how much it would cost or what the limit would be on free reading. They stressed that the amount of free access could change with time, in response to economic conditions and reader demand.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let's talk a little bit more about that.</p>
<h3>First, the good</h3>
<p>The idea of a fluctuating amount is great. I think this conveys trust in your brand and encourages constant interaction. It invites users to continually check your price and lets them know that you're being sensitive to their needs and current events. Kind of important for a paper.</p>
<p>And the idea of charging is good. You can't run your business at a loss. The internet is growing up, the dot-com bubble has bursted, re-inflated, and re-bursted. Let's find ways to monetize this thing or go back to working at the mill.</p>
<h3>But then, the bad</h3>
<p>I don't buy the idea that the problem is the payment. My parents' generation has been paying for newspapers since they were delivered by wooly mammoths. And the type of people who are interested in what the NYT has to say are the type of people who are willing to pay for it. Just because Facebook and Twitter are free doesn't mean everyone in the 18-25 demographic will never pay for anything again<sup id="2010_01_20_fnlink1"><a href="#2010_01_20_fn1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>I'd posit that their "fundamental questions" are wrong. If I land on an NYT page asking me to pay for the content, do you know what's easier? Going back to Google and looking for the same thing on the Atlanta Journal Constitution or the Wall Street Journal. And do you know what's easier than logging in to read news? Not logging in to read news.</p>
<p>How they are going to solve <strong>this</strong> problem is the real question.</p>
<h3>Glad you asked</h3>
<p>For news, the initial shock of a login system and the inconvenience of it are simply too much. And I see two options for success.</p>
<p><strong>One</strong>. If the New York Times can succeed in this new world, it might require they develop a renewed voice and a stronger tribe.</p>
<p>The readers who define the NYT and the Wall Street Journal are getting old. They're going in to that last two-thirds of their life that we call "retirement."</p>
<p>These monolithic newspaper companies are now competing with fast, nimble organizations that aren't in the newspaper printing business. They're not even necessarily in the news business. Think <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/">Fast Company</a>, <a href="http://37signals.com/">37 Signals</a>, and <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/">The Huffington Post</a>. Then think of the thousands of speciality-sites killing it in their own industry. For free<sup id="2010_01_20_fnlink2"><a href="#2010_01_20_fn2">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>You can try and compete with each of these in your traditional newspaper sections&mdash;technology, world, local, etc. Or you can try and compete with <a href="http://alltop.com/">Alltop</a> as an idea-aggregator. But either way, kick the notion that you're competing with the other local or national papers.</p>
<p>Wherever you decide to go, if you're going to charge, and if people are going to pay, you can't go on as you are.</p>
<p><strong>Two</strong>. Eliminate the interface barriers.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Develop the best damn news-delivery interface the world has ever seen. (Perhaps along the lines of the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/timesskimmer/">Times Skimmer</a>?)</li>
    <li>Somehow beat Twitter for speed and the aforementioned "new competitors" for quality.</li>
    <li>Find a way to make login painless, or better, unnecessary. Err on the side of accidentally giving someone free access instead of accidentally making someone login.</li>
    <li>Convince your audience that your site is the <strong>single best place</strong> for them to get news, and never disappoint them when they come to you looking for something.</li>
</ul>
<p>I frankly don't know if solution two is possible. And in the end, surviving as a company might mean narrowing your focus, developing your voice, and accepting smaller revenues. People will pay, but ad revenue will shrink, and circulation will narrow. This is less-than-ideal for a business whose job is to increase revenue, but it's markedly better than bankruptcy.</p>
