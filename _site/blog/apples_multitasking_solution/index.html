And previously, on the iPhone. But they're framing this discussion in the wrong way.</p>
<h3>Apple can't do multitasking</h3>
<p>For some reason, this is how the debate is framed. "Apple can't figure it out." "The processor isn't powerful enough." "No multitaskz?! Apple FAIL!!11!."</p>
<p>The fundamental issue here isn't that Apple can't figure out how to offer multitasking or can't come up with the technology for it. The technology community keeps having that discussion again and again.</p>
<p>The real issue is that Apple doesn't want multitasking. Apple, like <a href="http://www.davecrenshaw.com/the-myth-of-multitasking.php">Dave Crenshaw</a>, knows something that most of us are too stubborn to concede. <strong>Multitasking causes problems.</strong></p>
<h3>Problems? What problems?</h3>
<p>For the casual user, multiple simultaneous applications present a paradigm problem. The model is abstracted too much. You have an application, in which you have a window (many times abstracted further by tabs), in which you have the tasks you wish to complete. At any given point, you might have zero windows open or one thousand windows open. Either situation brings confusion.</p>
<p>For the power user, multiple simultaneous applications present a paradigm problem. Too often I end up with this:</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog-img/2010-02-05-toomany.jpg" alt="Too many applications" width="430" height="269" class="center" /></p>
<p>Just before I end up with this:</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog-img/2010-02-05-psquit.jpg" alt="Photoshop Quit" width="430" height="168" class="center" /></p>
<p>Or I end up with this:</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog-img/2010-02-05-toowide.jpg" alt="Too Wide" width="430" height="85" class="center" /></p>
<p>All of which are confusing and irritating situations for me. I can imagine this is only exacerbated if someone is simply a casual computer user or new to computing altogether.</p>
<h3>A better way</h3>
<p>Apple, however, implicitly proposes a solution.</p>
<p>Allow multitasking. But by making switching applications just as simple as running multiple applications at the same time.</p>
<p>You want to multitask with applications? Just close one, open the other, and the SDK will allow developers to automatically save your state. System-level cut, copy, and paste also mean you can easily transfer text and images between applications.</p>
<p>Now, you no longer have to deal with multiple applications being open, memory being eaten by tasks you're unaware of, or crashes from too many things going on at once.</p>
<p>If each of my applications would open via a simple process in a near-instant, my need for multiple applications would be nearly obliterated.</p>
<p>Not <strong>completely</strong> though. From time-to-time I need to split windows like this:</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog-img/2010-02-05-splitscreen.jpg" alt="Split screen windows" width="430" height="269" class="center" /></p>
<p>And I consider some of my utilities that run in the background as non-negotiables (looking at you <a href="http://code.google.com/p/blacktree-alchemy/">Quicksilver</a>, <a href="http://www.smileonmymac.com/TextExpander/">TextExpander</a>, <a href="http://agilewebsolutions.com/products/1Password">1Password</a>, and <a href="http://droplr.com/hello">Droplr</a>.)</p>
<p>But you know who doesn't? Your mom. Or the average user.</p>
<p>Apple isn't looking to replace your MacBook Pro. Or your Mac Pro. Perhaps OS 11 will take things in the direction of the iPhone OS, but I hope not, and I doubt it.</p>
<p>What they've done is made a consumer-level machine that removes abstractions. No application/window/tabs/tasks model. No mouse and click model. No desktop metaphor.</p>
<p>It's not a failure. Or a misstep. Or a dealbreaker. It's just not a computer for you and your creative power. But for John Doe, the iPad is the future of computing.</p>
