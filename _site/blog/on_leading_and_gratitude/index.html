    		<p>Great leaders are grateful. Some of the men and women in my life (many without any online presence to link to, so this certainly isn't a technological point) who have influenced me the most share a common characteristic: <strong>they're incredibly gracious and appreciative.</strong> They affirm. They give. They thank.</p>
<p>But why?</p>
<p>Great leaders appreciate the investment of others, which helped them get where they are. They're not hopelessly nostalgic, but they're insightful enough to know they couldn't have gotten here alone. They're grateful for the muses on their journey. Great leaders are also famously prescient. They understand what's coming, and they're grateful for those that will help them get there.</p>
<p>But more than anything, great leaders understand people. Before delivering a new product, moving a non-profit towards viability, or beginning a new venture, they understand humanity&mdash;needs, desires, feelings. Understanding those things, they deliver products or services that meet needs or desires, and the most successful leaders deliver experiences with positive feelings. The truly astute know their co-laborers, peers, superiors, and team members have the same needs, desires, and feelings as their consumers. And they know their praise, in whatever form it comes, fuels them towards a common mission.</p>
<p>And when you grasp that, this naturally follows: <strong>in the long term, unless you're grateful, you'll never be successful.</strong></p>
