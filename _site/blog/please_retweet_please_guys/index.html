    		<p>You'll surely find yourself more fulfilled by <a href="http://evhead.com/2009/11/why-retweet-works-way-it-does.html">Evan Williams' explanation</a> than my own. Read on at your own peril.</p>
<h3>A quick primer on a new feature</h3>
<p>Twitter recently implemented a new "retweet" feature. They've created a system where a User A can click "retweet" when viewing User B's message. Then, all who follow User A will see User B's status update in their own timelines, displayed thusly:</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog-img/2009-11-18-retweet.jpg" width="420" height="59" class="center" /></p>
<p>So you get:</p>
<ul>
    <li>An unknown avatar</li>
    <li>A little icon (that feels pretty out-of-place to Twitter's aesthetic)</li>
    <li>A line break plus appended, "Retweeted by [user]"</li>
</ul>
<h3>Pitchforks are ready, and heads must roll</h3>
<p>This is true of mostly any major feature change. And I don't think the complainers are without reason. Here are some of the leading arguments against the new feature (partially drawn from <a href="http://outspokenmedia.com/social-media/twitters-new-retweet-feature-sucks/">this post</a> and partially from various other arguments aggregated over time):</p>
<ul>
    <li>Who is this person in my stream?!</li>
    <li>But I want to add some context!</li>
    <li>People should know it came from <strong>me</strong>!</li>
    <li>What was wrong with the way it was?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Whoa, guys! Wait a second!</h3>
<p>I should begin by saying I am not a big fan of "retweeting." Occasionally, it's certainly warranted, but for some folks, it's like Twitter crack. They just can't stop. Come up with something to say of your own, and if someone else has enough good things to say, suggest to your Twitter crowd that they follow that person.</p>
<p>That being said, let's take a look at some of the arguments against the new implementation, and let's work last to first.</p>
<p>Lots of folks are missing the way it was, which is all right. But creating an official protocol for this function allows for all sorts of applications—mobile, web, and desktop—to access it via the API and creates a more uniform experience for Twitter users. Additionally, redundancy issues abound. In the search feature, you can end up with the whole search query filled by messages prepended with "RT @username", and in your own timeline, five people might post the same update. And some people thought it'd be fun to take a crap in the sandbox. They figured out they could have people follow them, retweet some message a thousand times and win a neat prize. They got high-volume, low-value followers and empty mentions, and we got a broken Twitter.</p>
<p>It's hard to argue against native support. Many people would give me this point, but they're still up in arms about the implementation.</p>
<p>The loudest grumbles come in the form of users complaining that strangers are popping up in their timeline, and this offends on two fronts: the first, it is confusing, and the second, it's not immediately obvious who second-hand shared the update. I think this could definitely be done a little bit better. A mockup of one thing I think would improve the system is below.</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog-img/retweet2.jpg" width="420" height="164" class="center" />
&lt;p class="image_caption"&gt;This would use the <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%40jpcody">search-style reply images</a> to display who did the retweeting.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>I'd find this a bit of an improvement, <strong>but I do think the current, official system is better than the old system.</strong> The way things were, credit for the original poster was little-to-none. A small text-link that was subconsciously dismissed due to the prepended "RT @." Individuals coming up with content worth being shared deserve more credit than this. They deserve for their original content to be seen in its original format—next to their avatar, prepended by their username.</p>
<p>In unofficial retweet syntax, all of the credit goes to the one who re-posted the original message. And that's not right. (I will reiterate that I realize the original poster received a text link, but due to the frequency of the syntax, most of the time I found myself subliminally discarding this opening information.)</p>
<p>But, wait! You want to add context, too! Thus, you get about six thousand of these in your timeline as people look at add "context" and keep it under 140 characters:</p>
<p class="big_quote">RT @username blah blah blah blah blah // WOW! lolzzz!</p>
<p class="center">&mdash;or&mdash;</p>
<p class="big_quote">RT @username I wnt 2 th str &amp; thnk I sw Jn Gsslin frm Jn&amp;Kt+8! | kewl!</p>
<p>This isn't always the case, and sometimes people can add great context with limited characters. But do you want to really add context? Begin your message with "re: http://j.mp/link", linking to the original post and having 120 characters for <strong>real, thorough</strong> context.</p>
<h3>C'mon, put the pitchfork down.</h3>
<p>It's certainly not perfect, and the implementation has a ways to go. But it's a heck of a lot better than the old madness.</p>
<p>I haven't covered all of the complaints, and perhaps I've missed some glaring ones, but I think proper attribution and minimizing redundancy can trump any argument I could imagine.</p>
<p>My biggest complaint? It's not very easy to mute a compulsive retweeter. It's possible without <em>too</em> much clicking around, but it's certainly not readily obvious.</p>
<p>And I certainly plan to use it for those using the new feature gratuitously.</p>
