    		<p>The iPad has generated lots of discussion about computing metaphors, computer interactions, and general technology. Of course, there's been plenty of the usual banter as the masses decry the closed platform, the evils of the App Store, the lack of an optical drive, and so on and so forth. That's to be expected of anything worth discussing.</p>
<h3>Creation and Consumption</h3>
<p>But I'm particularly intrigued at the discussion of creation versus consumption circling around <a href="http://al3x.net/2010/01/28/ipad.html">Alex Payne</a>, <a href="http://joshuablankenship.com/blog/2010/01/28/on-the-ipad-for-serious-this-time/">Joshua Blankenship</a>, <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2010/01/27/iPad">Tim Bray</a>, and <a href="http://createdigitalmusic.com/2010/01/27/how-a-great-product-can-be-bad-news-apple-ipad-and-the-closed-mac/">Peter Kirn</a>. The first two gentlemen, in particular, are men who create things that make me want to <strong>a) be better</strong> and <strong>b) give up because I'll never match them</strong>.</p>
<p>Joshua Blankeship had this to say:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>But the iPad is not designed to fill my desire to create, it’s mainly designed for me to consume the creations of others. It will change the landscape of personal computing and find its way into the hands of a ridiculous amount of people who are very happy to simply consume. My hands just won’t be among them anytime soon. I have too much creating to do.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He's a careful, caring guy. But I think he goes a bit too far here with his tone towards this machine.</p>
<p>The folks I've seen discussing this are in two fields&mdash;design and development. Ten inches of screen real estate and no physical keyboard aren't right for <em>their type of creation.</em> But for other creators, I think this device can really hit the sweet spot; especially at $499. Let's look at a few ways this could help creators:</p>
<h3>Types of Creators</h3>
<p><strong>Writers.</strong> Imagine <a href="http://www.ommwriter.com/">Ommwriter</a> on this thing, with the physical keyboard dock. You've got a 10-inch machine, capable and portable, that's <em>perfect</em> for writing extended works. Additionally, no multi-tasking has the benefit of no distractions. It's also nice for people who need to create short-form content on the road: bloggers, copywriters, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Photographers and designers.</strong> At $499, this would be a great second machine for creatives. Your portfolio, wireframes, sketches, etc. It's portability is key here. As a second machine, you could easily sketch things here as you spoke with a client, giving them visual feedback and brainstorming. And it works anywhere. Whiteboards are gigantic, and laptops are feature-rich. It's certainly a nice-to-have.</p>
<p><strong>Leaders.</strong> With iBooks and portability, a device like this can give leaders the flexibility to inspire and challenge others as they go about creating environments and cultures. I know plenty of leaders who <strong>love</strong> their netbook because it lets them do what they need and create what they need on the go. I'm confident the iPad will only work better for this audience.</p>
<p><strong>Learners.</strong> Creators are, by nature, learners. On your person, you can have <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Elements-Style-Fourth-William-Strunk/dp/020530902X">The Elements of Style</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Elements-Typographic-Style-Robert-Bringhurst/dp/0881791326">The Elements of Typographic Style</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">Wikipedia</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cormac_McCarthy#Published_works">A Cormac McCarthy novel</a>, your favorite photographer's entire portfolio, and anything else you need. There is a certain paralysis that comes with too much information, but there is also a certain freedom. I'd never be where I am today without the wealth of information made available online and the democratization of knowledge.</p>
<h3>The Takeaway</h3>
<p>I'm right with the spirit of what some of those before me have said. Creators have to constantly fight the battle of consumption paralysis. And ravenous consumption will inhibit the progress of many would-be creators.</p>
<p>And this device isn't geared for heavy-duty creation. But it can certainly help some people continue creating with more flexibility.</p>
<p>And what of consumption? Everyone consumes; it's inevitable. But it's not up to Apple what you consume. It's up to you.</p>
