    		<p>Caroline and I are staying at a hotel in San Diego to get a three-day break from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland,_Oregon#Climate">winter in Portland</a>. We fly for nearly free thanks to parents at Delta, I can work from the road, and we scored a great deal on our accommodations on <a href="http://priceline.com">Priceline</a>. Despite the good price, I'd never stay here again, but I'm not going to complain about it.</p>
<p>The guest representative let us know the airport shuttle would arrive in ten minutes, but it took an hour. I have called the front desk multiple times with no answer. Our bed smells like tacky perfume. The sink leaks to the bathroom floor. None of these things are major, but they add up. And, based on my experience as in high school statistics, four problems are not an anomaly, they are systemic.</p>
<h3>Dang man, tell them!</h3>
<p>I won't mention it. I'm not the complaining type. I tend to eschew conflict where possible, try not to be disruptive, and worry that I'm simply being a pain <sup id="2010_02_15_fnlink1"><a href="#2010_02_15_fn1">1</a></sup>. I'm having a great time with my wife exploring a new city, and I have better things to do than fight with an underpaid, overworked hotel manager.</p>
<p>But I'll never be back.</p>
<p>This is where it's important to use your own service, personally solicit feedback, get things right the first time, and fix problems before people ever complain. For every guest, customer, or individual who complains, there are plenty who don't. Who you'll never get back. Who are costing you money.</p>
<h3>So what? You just got it on <a href="http://priceline.com">Priceline</a>.</h3>
<p>Every customer is just as valuable as another. Whether they are providing profit or helping to cut the loss, they're doing you a favor by choosing your organization. Whether they're using <a href="http://nightly.webkit.org/">Webkit nightly builds</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer_7">Internet Explorer</a>, they're still a customer. Never become of the mind that one customer is more valuable than another. They're customers, and they're serving you. It's your job to give them the best possible experience.</p>
<p>If you're married to utilitarianism, then think of it this way: You don't know how frequently any given customer will return. You don't know their network and influence. You don't know when and where they'll review your organization. And as a business-owner, you can't afford to take a chance that their impact will be disproportionate to their price point.</p>
<h3>Too negative, shut up.</h3>
<p>All right, how about this? Same trip story.</p>
<p>My wife and I had lunch at <a href="http://chickfila.com/">Chick-fil-a</a> here in San Diego. And some friends here in San Diego were so gracious to drive us&mdash;us being without a car and all. We ordered lunch for ourselves and friends, and one of the eight total items we ordered was not ready at the same time as the others.</p>
<p>They graciously informed us that they'd bring the sandwich to our table when it was ready. We didn't complain. No big deal. But when they brought it, they brought a coupon for a free meal along with it.</p>
<p>Later in the day, after our friends were gone, we took our coupon, bought two bus passes, and rode 30 minutes back to Chickfila.</p>
<p>Now <strong>that</strong> is how you proactively address problems and build intense loyalty.</p>

    <li id="2010_02_15_fn1">I'm framing this trait positively. It's not without its downfalls of problems that grow unnecessarily large, miscommunications, and avoidable relational pain. <a href="#2010_02_15_fnlink1" class="small_caps">&nbsp;&nbsp;[Jump back]</a></li>
