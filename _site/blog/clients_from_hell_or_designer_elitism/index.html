    		<p>By now, you've surely heard of <a href="http://clientsfromhell.tumblr.com/">Clients From Hell</a>. If not, go ahead and read some of the stories, then come back here.</p>
<p>At first glance, it's funny. You might laugh for awhile as you flip through the stories. But at some point, you should likely come to the following question: <strong>Why are these designers so arrogant and condescending towards their clients?</strong></p>
<h3>I'll tell you why</h3>
<p>Clients generally don't understand the web. They don't know well enough to know that giving away a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Canon-EOS-5D-Mark-II/dp/B001G5ZTLS">Canon 5D Mark II</a> is a good way to get traffic on Twitter. And they don't know well enough to know that this traffic is cheap and won't get them anywhere in the long run. They just did a complete 360-degree turn without knowing it happened.</p>
<p>The things they're asking for&mdash;dogs chasing the cursor on a screen, seventeen different fonts on a page, MySpace sites for kids aged 1-5&mdash;aren't indicative of the fact that they're glaring idiots. (Some exceptions naturally apply.) They're indicative of people coming to you, trustingly, to help them in a medium they don't understand. They're looking to command attention in a space where they're not sure how to achieve that goal.</p>
<h3>The real problem</h3>
<p>So here's a little nugget of information for designers, myself included from time to time: <strong>The problem isn't that your clients are complete morons, the problem is that you're a complete asshole.</strong></p>
<p>Treat your clients as humans&mdash;humans that you can help. They have dreams and goals and aspirations, and they're asking for you to partner with them, to help them in this world of 0s and 1s and usability and standards and nerds. A world they don't understand, but you do.</p>
<p>The real issue is that, for whatever reasons, designers tend to feel we're part of some select aristocracy, doing the masses a service by relating with them. We're short-tempered, impatient, unhelpful, and condescending. Not all, and not always. But many, and often.</p>
<p>And rather than trying to kindly help those who don't understand, we scuttle off to our cyber-nerd-rooms to make them the punch line of our jokes. Real easy to say when you hide behind your IP address or avatar, isn't it?</p>
<h3>A simple manifesto</h3>
<p>Whether I'm designing, dreaming, planning, chatting or other-ing&mdash;online or off, I'll treat others like they're real, human people. People who deserve love and respect. And I hope you'll do the same.<sup id="2010_01_09_fnlink1"><a href="#2010_01_09_fn2">1</a></sup></p>
