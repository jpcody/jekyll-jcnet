<p>I think our internal value-meters are a bit dull these days. As we face a host of options and products daily, the simplest heuristic is to spread our time and money as thinly as possible. If we buy the most things at the least cost, then surely we will be met with satisfaction.</p>
<p>This is <strong>quantitative value</strong>.</p>
<h3>On quantitative value</h3>
<p>Recently, I've struggled with the ideas of <em>value</em> and <em>density</em>. Marketing trends tell us the two are synonymous. I think the difference is subtle, but its implications are far-reaching.</p>
<p>Just because McDonalds offers more beef per dollar does not make it the better value. Simply because one person can quote a project at a lower number does not make them the better value. In a program, more features for less money does not always equate to a better value.</p>
<p>Too often, we view value as <em>quantity &divide; cost</em>, or density.</p>
<h3>A better way</h3>
<p>Sure, quantitative value is simple, but it's short-sighted. We should actually be calculating <em>quality &divide; cost</em>. Quality is messy. It's inexact. It's <strong>not</strong> quantity. So too often we default to quantity.</p>
<p>Quality is how the new car purchase will hold up in ten years. It's about asking yourself what your goals and values are, then determining whether a purchase leads you towards said goals and values.</p>
<p>Quantitive value only involves a cursory understanding of the product. Qualitive value involves a meticulous understand of yourself.</p>
