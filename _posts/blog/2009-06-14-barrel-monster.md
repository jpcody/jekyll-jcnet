<p>I've got a minor fascination with street art and the subversive in general. It's for that reason that I was struck by <a href="http://www.woostercollective.com/2009/06/barrel_monsters.html">this barrel monster</a> created by an NC State University student. It's a bummer that he was arrested, but I imagine street art wouldn't be nearly as fun if it were legalized.</p>
