<p class="big_quote">Disappointment is a byproduct of unmet expectations.</p>
<p>Always. So when you're feeling disappointed, ask yourself two questions:</p>
<ul>
	<li>What expectations were communicated that went unmet?</li>
	<li>What expectations were assumed, although never communicated?</li>
</ul>
<p>And when you're feeling angry, sad, or irritated? Ask yourself if what you <strong>actually</strong> are is disappointed.</p>
