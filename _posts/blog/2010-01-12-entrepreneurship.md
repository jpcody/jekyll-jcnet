<p>Before you pursue business opportunities, ask yourself this question:</p>
<p>Do I want to be a <strong>serial entrepreneur</strong>, investing where I see short-term opportunity, and using the ensuing windfall to fund my passions? Or do I want to <strong>build a brand</strong>, pursuing my passions directly as a long-term opportunity?</p>
<p>Neither is better than the other (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Richard_Branson%27s_business_ventures">Richard Branson</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs">Steve Jobs</a>), but deciding early will help you avoid plenty of growing pains.</p>
