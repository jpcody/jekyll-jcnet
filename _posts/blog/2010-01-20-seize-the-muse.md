<p>Recently, I feel like I've been witness to a few too many ideas passing me by. Not passing me by for a lack of merit or an innate implausibility, but passing me by because my passion wanes.</p>
<p>I'm still wrestling with whether this is simply the nature of ideas or I rested on my laurels for too long. And I don't think it's an answer that will come easily.</p>
<p>But the point remains. In language that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/War-Art-Through-Creative-Battles/dp/0446691437">Steven Pressfield</a> would approve of: when you've put yourself in the right position, and the muse is ready to touch you, you'd better be ready to throw everything else aside and chase her. She won't last long.</p>
<p>Jason Fried of 37 Signals <a href="http://www.vimeo.com/4717683?pg=embed&amp;sec=">said the same thing</a> much more eloquently in 2009 (excuse the huge quote wall, but it's <em>that</em> good):</p>
<blockquote><p>Inspiration is perishable. We all have ideas, and once you have the idea, the idea is sort of immortal. It lives on forever; it goes on forever. The idea exists, even if it's just in your head or you write it down, it's happened. But what isn't going to last forever is your inspiration for that idea. Inspirations are like fresh fruit, like milk—they have an expiration date, and they don't last very long.</p>
<p>If you happen to be lucky enough and fortunate enough to be inspired to do something, you've got to do it right now because every day you go, it gets browner and browner and deader and starts to rot and goes away. Inspiration is perishable, you can not hang on to it. So if you find something you want to do, you've just got to go out and do it.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you're in the business of creating, you'd better be ready to move quick. Nothing gold can stay.</p>
