<p>Recently, I wrote of <a href="http://joshuacody.net/blog/the_two_types_of_value">two kinds of value</a>, particularly with regards to the things we consume. But there's something that defines us much more than the things we consume. And that's how we spend our <em>time</em>.</p>
<p>And here, we make the same fundamental error as with the things we buy. We look to pack as may things as possible into our days, no matter the cost. We're looking at creating the densest possible days.</p>
<p>There's nothing I could add to <a href="http://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/blog/time-management-how-an-mit-postdoc-writes-3-books-a-phd-defense-and-6-peer-reviewed-papers-and-finishes-by-530pm/">this article</a>, but I'll leave you with a quote on your way to read it.</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>You could fill any arbitrary number of hours with what feels to be productive work. Between e-mail, and crucial web surfing, and to-do lists that, in the age of David Allen, grow to lengths that rival the bible, there is always something you could be doing. At some point, however, you have to put a stake in the ground and say: I know I have a never-ending stream of work, but this is when I’m going to face it. If you don’t, you’ll let this work push you around like a bully. It will force you into tiring, inefficient schedules, and you’ll end up more stressed and no more accomplished.</p>
