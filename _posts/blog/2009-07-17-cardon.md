<blockquote>
    <p>Cardon Copy, takes the vernacular of self-distributed fliers and tear-offs we have all seen in our neighborhoods. It involves hijacking these unconsidered fliers and redesigning them, over powering their message with a new visual language. I then replace the original with the redesign in its authentic environment.</p>

<p>A noble exercise, but one <a href="http://www.idsgn.org/posts/guerrilla-typography/#comments">idsgn commenter</a> aptly noted:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>A cool idea, but I am afraid the missing cat signs (specifically) would backfire. There is a visceral, human urgency in handmade/unprofessional signs asking for help. A stylized presentation would make the average passerby skeptical and therefore less likely to help.</p>

<p>I think something like this is more desirable as a design practice than an actual stealing and replacing of work. I would be more likely to think this was a design project than an actual plea.</p>
