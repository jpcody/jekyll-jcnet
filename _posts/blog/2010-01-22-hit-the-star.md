<p>One of the uses of Twitter I admire most is a delivery vehicle of succinct, well-thought, original content. That being said, I use the the "star" feature pretty often, and I'm convinced I'm in the minority here. (See <a href="http://help.twitter.com/forums/10711/entries/14214">Twitter's official documentation</a> on the feature.) Whether I'm marking a link to read later, saving a piece of wisdom, or bookmarking a great quip, I'm hitting the star all the time.</p>
<p>That being said, I thought I'd curate my list of curated Twitter updates to post my 13 favorite updates of all-time. Where all-time is equal to the amount of time I have been using Twitter and actively hitting the star. Without further ado, and in no particular order, here are the best of the best:</p>
