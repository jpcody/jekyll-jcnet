<p><a href="http://pinboard.in/">Pinboard</a> bills itself as "antisocial bookmarking." By default, all your bookmarks are private, it doesn't have a design worth sharing (it's not dissimilar from <a href="http://wrongtomorrow.com/">Wrong Tomorrow</a>, another site by Maciej Ceglowski) and built-in sharing features are pretty minimal. Oh, and it's not free. That brings forward one big question: <strong>What's so great about Pinboard?</strong></p>
<h3>Speed</h3>
<p>When you visit the page, three elements are given obvious visual precedence: the brand, the main navigation, and the time it took for the page to load. The current page I'm on? 0.044 seconds, or 44 milliseconds. So what's the difference between .044 seconds and one second? And why would a company make this their third most-weighted design element?</p>
<p>One study, from The Human Oriented Technology Lab suggests that your visitors <a href="http://www.carleton.ca/hotlab/Abstracts/LindgaardG.FernandesG.Dud.html">judge your site in 50 milliseconds</a>, or 1/20th of a second. Obviously, visitors aren't leaving your site if you're not ready within that 50 millisecond threshold, and this is only one study. But it does show the importance of speed and time—revealing that we have less time than we think to impress.</p>
<p>Prefer to speak revenue? BlinkList.com made an improvement of a few milliseconds, and they saw their <a href="http://blog.mindvalleylabs.com/gone-in-4-seconds-why-your-page-load-speed-matters/176/">revenue jump 25%</a>. Speed matters.</p>

<h3>The Cost</h3>
<p>I'm not sure exactly how Pinboard got their idea for what to charge for their service (Although some insight is given. It was apparently conceived by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_Schachter">Joshua Schachter</a>, previously of Del.icio.us, but I may be interpreting <a href="http://twitter.com/PinboardIN/statuses/2629590295">this Twitter update</a> incorrectly.), but here is how it breaks down: total number of users * $.001 is what you pay . As of now, it's $4.84, which means 4,84[0-9] people have signed up for the service, if I'm correct. I believe the average amount they have paid is half of $4.84, which would be $2.42, which is around $11,724 for the developer. That's a pretty good boost towards development. But a rich developer isn't the only reason charging like this is such a great idea.</p>
<ul>
    <li>It slows growth. Some services grow too fast, and they just can't handle the server loads and difficulties of a growing business. Twitter was a good example of this, although they seem to have made it through their growing pains.</li>
    <li>It values early adopters. It makes the barrier of entry lower for the people who are likely to give better feedback, be more involved and spread the word about your product.</li>
    <li>It discourages unintended use. <a href="http://ask.metafilter.com/">Ask Metafilter</a> charges users a $5 one-time signup fee, and it's mostly a spam-free thriving community. It's amazing what a small barrier-to-entry can do to zap a spambot.</li>
    <li>It keeps out advertising. I place a lot of value on my attention, and if I can shave seconds and manage my focus more effectively, I'll gladly drop a few bones to do so.</li>
</ul>
<p>All in all, this small fee provides a boost to development and will make Pinboard a vastly improved product. It's surprising to me the number of people who won't pay a fee of less than a fast food meal for an application, program, or service that they'll use day-in and day-out. This is pretty essential capitalism—if something is worth it, then pay for it. The world will be a better place for it.</p>
<h3>And A Little More</h3>
<p>Speed is undoubtedly the most important interface priority, but beyond that, there are a few other niceties. Clean URLs, AJAX goodness and pure simplicity make the interface a pleasure.</p>
<p>Outside of the visual interface, the idea of implementing a "to read" permatag is great. So often I want to mark something to read later, and it just permeates my bookmarks indefinitely.</p>
<p>And don't miss out on the copywriting. It's pithy, clever, and wonderful&mdash;complete with little shots at <a href="http://corvusconsulting.ca/2009/02/ma-gnolias-bad-day/">Ma.gnolia</a> and Del.icio.us, if you can find them. The features roadmap is insightful, and the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/pinboard-dev/">developer group</a> is responsive and helpful.</p>
<h3>But It's Not All Peachy</h3>
<p>It's certainly a new service, and it shows in their interface. Some things are nonsensical or lacking as far as what you'd hope in using the service.That said, here are my gripes, mostly interface-related, as I feel the feature set is pretty satisfactory:</p>
<ul>
    <li>There's no way to toggle views between private and public items. And the private/public delineator next to your username is disconnected from any context to suggest meaning.</li>
    <li>Bulk editing is weak at best, handled only by the burdensome process of bulk starring, loading a new page, and then editing. Tons of room for improvement here.</li>
    <li>Settings are pretty text-heavy. The majority of the information is irrelevant to to the average user and could be revealed only when necessary, but I'm nitpicking here.</li>
    <li>Hover behavior needs a little attention. When hovering on a star, you get a cursor rather than pointer, and when hovering on any other link, you get nothing. This would make a big difference in usability.</li>
</ul>
<p>All in all, I'd give the service a heavy recommendation. And you can check out <a href="http://pinboard.in/u:jpcody/">my bookmarks</a> on your way to signing up.</p>
