<p>Earlier today, <a href="http://twitter.com/nevenmrgan">Neven Mrgan</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/siracusa">John Siracusa</a> were having a little chat about the adequacy of the <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2010/01/various_ipad_thoughts">automatic and manual transmission metaphor</a> making the rounds in the iPad context.</p>
<p>If you don't know Neven<sup id="2010_01_29_fnlink1"><a href="#2010_01_29_fn1">1</a></sup>, he's a bright and kind guy. But given his brightness, he tends to disagree with people online sometimes. Particularly, the aforementioned conversation and the occasional banter with <a href="http://twitter.com/hotdogsladies">Merlin Mann</a>. And when he disagrees, he wants to keep it nice. So he adds a colon-parenthases emoticon<sup id="2010_01_29_fnlink2"><a href="#2010_01_29_fn2">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Over time, this gets awkward, and it brought me to a simple realization, which I shall call Neven's Law. It can ring true of Twitter, online chatting, and email. Essentially, any digital, written communication:</p>
<p class="big_quote">The appropriateness of a medium is inversely proportional to the number of emoticons necessary in a given discussion.</p>
<p>Now, I appreciate them having these conversations in public so the masses can participate. But now that we have a law, perhaps we can apply it and bump these conversations up to the easiest-possible theater where emoticons are no longer necessary. </p>
<p>Or, we can continue with our emoticons&mdash;using them as clues for the audience that, "this would be better said elsewhere." But there you have it. Now go forth with your new knowledge and continue discussing.</p>

    <li id="2010_01_29_fn1">I use "know" in the most internet-sense here. I know him because I follow him online. The respect kind, not the creepy kind. Oh, and I saw him at <a href="http://podnahspit.com/">Podnah's Pit</a> once. <a href="#2010_01_29_fnlink1" class="small_caps">&nbsp;&nbsp;[Jump back]</a></li>
