<p class="note"><span class="small_caps">Editor's Note: </span>Somehow I missed that I originally posted this as <em>5 Albums to Remember From the 90s</em>. The error was sever, and we at joshuacody.net extend our most sincere apologies. And a tip o' the hat to <a href="http://twitter.com/jeff_goins">Jeff Goins</a> for the help.</p>
<p>Recently, <a href="http://mrgan.tumblr.com/post/304714649/favorite-music-2000s">Neven Mrgan</a> and <a href="http://armstrongcircus.com/blog/840/">Paul Armstrong</a> have both posted their best-of-the-decate music lists, and as I'd been thinking of doing my own for awhile, I figured I'd throw my hat in the ring as well. Neven makes a great point:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>I don’t trust my brain. Sure, it keeps me vertical most of the time, it tells me when I’m hungry, and I let it take care of the water bill. But ask it what my favorite music of the last decade was, and you’ll get a lot of hogwash comprising a neat mix of popular tunes, obscure concept albums, and hipster honor badges.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nonetheless, I'm not going to go the iTunes most-played route. It's not an accurate representation of what I listened to on various other devices and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc">compact discs</a> in the last 10 years. Oh, and bear in mind, I was a 12-year-old when this decade began. It should go without saying that my list will be backloaded, unless you want albums like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tubthumper">Chumbawumba's Tubthumping</a>.</p>
<p>Without further ado, with brief explanations appended, my favorite albums of the aughts.</p>
<h3>Copeland&mdash;Beneath Medicine Tree</h3>
<a href="http://www.lala.com/#album/1657606138229293178/Copeland/Beneath_Medicine_Tree"><img src="/images/blog-img/copeland.jpg" alt="Beneath Medicine Tree" width="200" height="200" class="center"/></a>
<p>Written during a particularly grueling period in lead singer Aaron Marsh's life, Beneath Medicine Tree deals extensively with hospitals, pain, and death. But at the end of it all, hope remains. Songs on this album pulled me through both the hospitalization of family members and the angst of late-teen romance. (And when you're a teenager, it's hard to tell which is worse.) Here's one particular verse that served as the anthem for plenty of walks in downtown Atlanta with myself and Caroline:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Through the night
    <br />
    We were waiting for a sign
    <br />
    Maybe rendered in the darkened sky
    <br />  
    Drawn by imaginary lines
    <br />
    Connecting radiant points of light
    <br />
    (please don't go)
    <br />
    Cause you showed up with your hair down
    <br />
    I might not sleep tonight</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>The National&mdash;Boxer</h3>
<a href="http://www.lala.com/#album/1225260573704657742/The_National/Boxer"><img src="/images/blog-img/national.jpg" alt="Boxer" width="200" height="200" class="center"/></a>
<p>This one wouldn't likely make any other best-of-the-decade lists. Most folks wouldn't even consider it the best album by The National. But, for me, there's something beautiful and dark about "Fake Empire" that reminds me of a very particular season in my life. Even more, standing at a particular place and thinking a particular thing. The tone of the entire album is sheer perfection for a summer night in the city.</p>
<h3>Brand New&mdash;The Devil and God Are Raging Inside Me</h3>
<a href="http://www.lala.com/#album/432627039263933890/Brand_New/The_Devil_And_God_Are_Raging_Inside_Me"><img src="/images/blog-img/brandnew.jpg" alt="The Devil and God are Raging Inside Me" width="200" height="200" class="center"/></a>
<p>If you hadn't noticed by the title, this is a difficult album. I'll quote effusively to prove my point:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I used to be such a burning example,
<br />
I used to be so original.
<br />
I used to care, I was being cared for.
<br />
Made sure I showed it to those that I love.</p>

<p>I used to sleep without a single stir,
<br />
'Cause I was about my father's work.</p>

<p>Well take me out tonight,
<br />
This ship of fools I'm on will sink.
<br />
A millstone around my neck,
<br />
Be my breath, there's nothing I wouldn't give.</p>

<p>I used to pray like God was listening.
<br />
I used to make my parents proud.
<br />
I was the glue that kept my friends together,
<br />
Now they don't talk and we don't go out.</p>

<p>I used to know the name of every person I'd kissed.
<br />
Now I made this bed and I can't fall asleep in it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No album of the decade so powerfully captured the human condition and the problem of evil. It drags you through the <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/10/18/national/main2101044.shtml">death of a seven-year-old girl</a> at the hands of a drunk driver, the loss of innocence, and failed relationships. Even redemption is framed as fear and hopelessness:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>I know you're coming in the night like a thief
    <br />
    But I've had some time, O Lord, to hone my lying technique
    <br />
    I know you think that I'm someone you can trust
    <br />
    But I'm scared I'll get scared and I swear I'll try to nail you back up</p>    
    <p>So do you think that we could work out a sign
    So I'll know it's you and that it's over so I won't even try</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, The Devil and God Are Raging Inside of Me reflects life for all of us at some time or another. Certainly not the most enjoyable album of the decade, but definitely the most sobering.</p>
<h3>Explosions in the Sky&mdash;The Earth is Not a Cold, Dead Place</h3>
<a href="http://www.lala.com/#album/5620773809945212824/Explosions_In_The_Sky/The_Earth_Is_Not_a_Cold_Dead_Place"><img src="/images/blog-img/explosions.jpg" alt="The Earth is Not a Cold, Dead Place" width="200" height="200" class="center"/></a>
<p>If you know me (no, really know me), then you are aware of my musical shortcomings. If you do not know me, then you should know, I have musical shortcomings. And not just any. We're talking borderline <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amusia">amusia</a> here. So it's no small feat that the entire instrumental <em>The Earth is Not a Cold, Dead Place</em> was able to impress me. I'd love to give more effusive praise for its melody, pitch, instrumentation, and musical perfection, but I'll leave that to people with two fully-functional ears.</p>
<h3>The Decemberists&mdash;Picaresque</h3>
<a href="http://www.lala.com/#album/2017894108902068380/The_Decemberists/Picaresque"><img src="/images/blog-img/decemberists.jpg" alt="Picaresque" width="200" height="200" class="center"/></a>
<p>Picaresque is a literati's musical dream. It's <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Candide/Voltaire/e/9781593080280/">Candide</a> set to music, the perfect example of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picaresque">picaresque</a>. You'll learn words you never knew you never knew (hat tip to last decade's Pocahontas) and get wrapped up in eleven beautiful acts that make up a nearly-perfect whole. My favorite story of the album climaxes thusly:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Meet me on my vast veranda 
    <br />
    My sweet, untouched Miranda 
    <br />
    And while the seagulls are crying 
    <br />
    We fall but our souls are flying</p></blockquote>
    <p>And each of the eleven songs are equally epic and perfect.</p>
