<p>John Siracusa of Ars Technica recently wrote <a href="http://arstechnica.com/staff/fatbits/2009/05/hypercritical.ars">Hypercritical</a>, an insightful look into the mind of those who were born to critique. It's a skill that I'm trying to develop more each day, but John is just on a whole different level. Don't trust me? Read his <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/reviews/2007/10/mac-os-x-10-5.ars">17-page review of Mac OS X Leopard</a>.</p>
<p>To take a single quote from his look at those who are hypercritical is a great injustice, but I'll do it anyways. But only after you promise to <a href="http://arstechnica.com/staff/fatbits/2009/05/hypercritical.ars">read the whole article</a>. Promise? Cross your heart? Cross it. OK.</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>The point is, ladies and gentleman, that criticism, for lack of a better word, is good. Criticism is right. Criticism works. Criticism clarifies, cuts through, and captures the essence of the evolutionary spiritâ€¦</p>
    <p>Okay, let me try that again. Actually, I'm on the same page as Gordon Gekko in one important respect. Like greed, criticism gets a bad rap, especially when it's presented in large doses. It's impolite. It's unnecessarily obsessive. It's just a bummer. But the truth is, precious little in life gets fixed in the absence of a good understanding of what's wrong with it to begin with.</p>
