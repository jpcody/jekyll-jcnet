<p>Simply put, it's the best movie I've seen this year. Brilliantly written, directed, and designed, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0887912/">The Hurt Locker</a> strikes the perfect blend of pure adrenaline and introspection. It's a far cry from the feeble-minded and heavy-handed attempts to demonize or glorify the Iraq War, opting to take an honest look at the psychological effects—good, bad, and necessary—of modern warfare.</p>
<p>The story follows Sergeant William James (played by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Renner">Jeremy Renner</a>) through his tour in Iraq as a member of a U.S. Army Explosive Ordnance Disposal unit. He's sharp-witted, loyal, courageous, reckless, and everything in between, and Renner's performance captures his complexity perfectly—a refreshing break from the flat characters of so many war movies. Sergeant James focuses on neither past nor future; instead, he spends the movie being, and director <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathryn_Bigelow">Kathryn Bigelow</a> slowly reveals his depth. This is the crux of the entire movie, and the plot serves only to slowly disclose James to us, and in turn, the difficult lives of men like him. (And the possibly more difficult lives of those surrounding them.)</p>
<p>For me, its only shortcoming was sloppy and forced dialogue in a small handful of scenes. This was nothing more than a blip on the radar. Nitpicking.</p>
<p>All in all, the movie riveted me for 128 minutes, and I left exhausted and contemplative. You can't merely watch <em>The Hurt Locker</em>, looking for escape or a catharsis. You participate in it, and you leave thankful for those you love and deeply concerned about the flawed human condition.</p>
