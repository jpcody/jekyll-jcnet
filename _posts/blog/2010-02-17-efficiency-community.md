<p>Efficiency is a friend to business and productivity, but it's an enemy of community. Trust and lasting relationships are built on the belief that the other party values <strong>you</strong> more than they value <strong>themselves</strong>.</p>

<p>And in order to truly value others, we set aside our schedules and plans. We let our coffee meetings run to two hours. We spontaneously drive an hour to Sonic. We take an hour on the phone even though we have a thousand other things to do.</p>

<p>If you're trying to keep your community efficient, you're depriving yourselves and those around you. Relationships are inefficient, but they're worth it.</p>
