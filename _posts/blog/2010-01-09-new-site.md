<p>Long, long ago, I penned an article <a href="http://joshuacody.net/blog/on_a_new_site">on a new site</a>. Since then, I've been tinkering with about a thousand redesigns. Finally, one stuck. I'll be brief, but I'd love to talk about it.</p>
<h3>What I'm happy with</h3>

<p><strong>The look and feel.</strong> Thanks to the fine folks at <a href="http://typekit.com/">Typekit</a>, I'm able to use <a href="http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=CTT0000136">Athelas</a> from Veer to really nail the feeling I'm looking for&mdash;a famiiar book, but repurposed for the web. The subtle background is meant to evoke the pages of <em><a href="http://www.powells.com/cgi-bin/biblio?inkey=2-9780881791327-1">The Elements of Typograhic Style</a></em>, and the header gives the slightest hint of the leather from the imaginary chair in your mahogany, book-lined library. I'm much happier and more at home here than I was with any previous looks.</p>
<p><strong>URL shortening.</strong> I like having the power of shortening my own URLs, thanks to <a href="http://shauninman.com/archive/2009/08/17/less_n">Shaun Inman</a>. I don't like the idea of shortening services <a href="http://mashable.com/2009/08/09/trim-shuts-down/">dying out</a> and all the links to my things turning to dust. Additionally, as an advantage over other, obscured URLs, I know any URL beginning with <em>http://jpcody.in/</em> will go to my own site. It's the little things that make the nerd world go round.</p>
<h3>On comments</h3>
<img src="/images/blog-img/2010_01_09_comment1.jpg" alt="Comments" width="430" height="150" class="center"/>
<p>I think I spoke too quickly in absolutes when I discussed comments <a href="http://joshuacody.net/blog/on_a_new_site">here</a>. Particularly, I'd like to rescind the following:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>I don't think blog comments are helpful...I don't believe giving you the option to comment on a post is actually helpful.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I hold to my belief that the best response is thoughtful and published somewhere online that you call your own. And I will still leave comments mostly closed on the site, with the occasional exception. Also, I'd still love to hear your thoughtful comments directed specifically at me, and where comments are closed, there will always be a contact form.</p>
<p>Essentially, this site it <strong>mine</strong>. It's a place for my voice and my opinions. I'm not looking to foster an online community. I'm not looking to build an army of loyal commenters. I'm not looking for pats on the back. I'm looking to invite you in to my place to hear what I have to say, if you're interested. Then, I wouldn't like you to scrawl your response on my wall or tables, but I'd like for you to keep the conversation going&mdash;with me and with others. And I still don't believe that comments provide the best medium for that healthy, thoughtful discussion. <sup id="2010_01_09_fnlink1"><a href="#2010_01_09_fn1">1</a></sup></p>
<h3>Some problems</h3>
<p>At this point, I'm still trying to determine the best way to implement a search function and an archive function. I'm not sure what these will eventually look like. Also, ExpressionEngine 2.0 is currently lacking a functional tagging plug-in, so this feature will be coming soon.</p>
<p>Things can get a bit tedious reading here long-form as well. I need to be careful to implement more images with articles.</p>
<p>Finally, the header navigation is big and obscure, and I'm already brainstorming how to make it go away.</p>
<p>All things being equal, I'm incredibly happy with this iteration of my own site. Principally because it makes me happy and feels like home, and you can't ask for much more in your own site.</p>
