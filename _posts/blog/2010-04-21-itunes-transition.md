<p>I wish iTunes had some sort of feature to stop playing after the current album. Here are alphabetical artist transitions that can bring any sort of zone I'm in, focus I have, or enjoyment of mine to a grinding and complete halt.</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="http://droplr.com/Rlffc">Bon Iver</a> to <a href="http://droplr.com/Rlhfh">Bone Thugs-N-Harmony</a>&mdash;From folksy falsetto to Flowmotion in two seconds flat. The most common and egregious transition.</li>
    <li><a href="http://droplr.com/Rl8cu">The Album Leaf</a> to <a href="http://droplr.com/Rlbej">The Fantastic Mr. Fox soundtrack</a>&mdash;Think chill, electronic post-rock. Then think of a hillbilly hoe down.</li>
    <li><a href="http://droplr.com/Rlm5L">Dixie Chicks</a> to <a href="http://droplr.com/Rlq4R">DJ Danger Mouse</a>&mdash;Their Home album is thoughtful, and slow, and reflective. DJ Danger Mouse is Jay-Z plus the Beatles.</li>
    <li><a href="http://droplr.com/RlxdN">Explosions in the Sky</a> to <a href="http://songza.org/~d6lof5">Falco</a>&mdash;Instrumental post-rock to Rock Me, Amadeus. Oh yeah.</li>
    <li><a href="http://droplr.com/RlK87">Radiohead</a> to <a href="http://droplr.com/RlLau">Rascal Flatts</a>&mdash;A very, very swift transition from electronica to embarrassing.</li>
    <li><a href="http://droplr.com/RlMfR">AC/DC</a> to <a href="http://droplr.com/RlN4X">Alabama</a>&mdash;I've never hit this one in day-to-day life as I don't listen much to either. But the thought is downright scary.</li>
</ul>
