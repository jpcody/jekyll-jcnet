    <p>We all know that there's no [REDACTED] way in the world we should have microwave ovens and refrigerators and TV sets and everything else at the prices we're paying for them.

Our standard of living. You want to "fix things in China," well, it's gonna cost you. Because everything you own, it's all done on the backs of millions of poor people whose lives are so awful you can't even begin to imagine them, people who will do anything to get a life that is a tiny bit better than the shitty one they were born into, people who get exploited and treated like shit and, in the worst of all cases, pay with their lives.</p>
