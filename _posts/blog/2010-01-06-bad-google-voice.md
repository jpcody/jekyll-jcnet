<p>Google Voice is pretty exciting in theory. One number to rule them all, archived and searchable SMS, voicemails stored as text, recording conversations, different rules for different contact groups. You've got to admit, those are some incredible features.</p>
<p>One of it's hilarious downfalls, however, is its inadequate transcription mechanism. I don't know of any better services out there, and it might be a lost cause, but Google Voice gives you some hilariously bad transcripts of voicemails.</p>
<p>Here are my three favorites, and I'd love to hear any bad experiences you have in the comments:</p>
<p class="big_quote">"...was just calling to you to give you some feedback on that because I need. Whatever it was. They, and, half, Jake, I have them. P F T files level of the web."</p>

<p class="big_quote">"Hey Josh, Chris over at springing just checking in with you. See if this is see if y'all had side. Whether you're gonna do the Do, The, The, The, pronounce that you wanted."</p>

<p class="big_quote">"I'm calling you a little trucks that way because I'm actually heading back to Atlanta and I'm analyst you think it's Chris, It's a for a wedding tomorrow right now. I, I. Anyways, and I got you."</p>
