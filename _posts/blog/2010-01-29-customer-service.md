<p><a href="http://twitter.com/jpcody/status/8383858116">This idea</a> hit me while navigating some sort of phone option choose-your-own-adventure thing:</p>
<p>Have an iPhone application that lets me select my options before calling, then hit a "call" button that goes straight to a human.</p>
<p>Want to go one better?</p>
<p>Allow the user to somehow let you know a favorite artist, perhaps when generating a support ID or upon calling, and generate a Pandora-esque playlist based on their preference as hold music.</p>
<p>And even one more. The best of all:</p>
<p>Have an iPhone application that lets me select my options, tells me an estimated wait time, and allows me to request someone <strong>call me</strong> when they're available.</p>
