Recently, I was reading an [interview with former Apple CEO John Sculley](http://www.cultofmac.com/john-sculley-on-steve-jobs-the-full-interview-transcript/63295) on Steve Jobs. By far, my favorite snippet was this, as Sculley describes Jobs' admiration for Dr. Edward Land, co-founder of Polaroid:

>    Both of them had this ability to not invent products, but discover products. Both of them said these products have always existed – it’s just that no one has ever seen them before. We were the ones who discovered them. The Polaroid camera always existed and the Macintosh always existed — it’s a matter of discovery.

It goes hand-in-hand with John Gruber's description of Stanley Kubrick discovering the perfect camera angle in his wonderful talk, [The Auteur Theory of Design](http://2010.dconstruct.org/speakers/john-gruber).

Things already exist—perfect camera angles, ingenious product ideas, beautiful songs, new strategies. But we have to have patience and dedication, then put ourselves in positions to discover them.
